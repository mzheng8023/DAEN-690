"Streams now offer better sound quality Norman Wittkopf \u00e2\u0080\u0093 With the increase in sound bit rate in Dolby Digital Plus and Dolby Atmos, Netflix offers \high quality sound\"" that should not significantly differ from studio quality despite compression. In addition, adaptive streaming should also ensure an improved user experience. As can be seen from a Netflix blog entry on audio technology, the threshold value for perceived differences in Dolby Digital Plus sound quality at 640 kbps has been determined based on different hearing aids and scientific studies. This corresponds to a compression ratio of 10: 1 compared to a 24-bit 5.1-channel studio master. Therefore, a higher bit rate would only be useless data transfer and bandwidth utilization, and note that \""these bit rates will evolve over time as the efficiency of our code processes increases.\"" 5.1 multichannel audio should be supported on supported devices in the network Grading parts between 192 and 640 kbit / s are supplied, which is still provided according to Netflix, even at the lowest level, a good listening experience. Similarly, they decided to increase the bit rate of the Dolby Atmos 3D audio format up to 768 kbit / s, which is only available to premium subscribers. Unlike the video stream, the quality of which has always been on Netflix custom tuned depending on bandwidth during streaming, the delivery of the audio stream has so far been static and set at the beginning depending on network performance. The adaptive approach has now also been implemented for audio streams, whereby data in the audio track is divided into several segments (\""bits\"") each with a few seconds of play time in different quality levels and appropriate level is played out depending on available bandwidth.  01:53 Netflix: Trailer with program highlights in May 2019 Source: via heise.de Also popular with PCGH readers: Netflix and Prime Video in May: The new films and series in the overview Updated: Here is an overview of the new films and series on Netflix and Amazon Prime Video available in May 2019.

"Emotive, Sydney snares highly-awarded creative Ben Clare from TBWA\\Sydney for group CD role Emotive, Sydney snares highly-awarded creative Ben Clare from TBWA\\Sydney for group CD role Emotive has today announced the appointment of Ben Clare to group creative director. A highly-awarded creative with over 13 years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 experience across Sydney and New York, Clare joins from TBWA Sydney where he was creative director. Prior to that, he has held positions at Clemenger BBDO Sydney and its creative consultancy, TKT Sydney, Johannes Leonardo in New York, JWT and HAVAS working on brands such as Google, Amazon, Qantas, Coca Cola, Tourism Australia, Foxtel, Frucor, Skittles, Campbells and more. His work has won hundreds of accolades and honours from all the major creative and effectiveness award shows; most notably winning the inaugural Mobile Grand Prix at Cannes for his Google campaign, Project Re: Brief. Beyond the office, Ben has taken an active role in mentoring advertising\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next generation, helping run creative and strategic courses at Miami Ad School for the past two years. Says Clare: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thrilled to be joining Emotive at such a pivotal moment in time for the agency. Their structure feels super collaborative and immediate, and the creative ambition feels matched only by their executional agility. At a time when brand communications elsewhere feel like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re being constrained by shorter and shorter media increments, Emotive has been able to develop some great, story-driven work. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really looking forward to heading up the creative department alongside Zane Pearson and the team to help continue to build something different and special.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Says Simon Joyce, CEO and founder, Emotive: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBen is a great talent, great guy and a great addition to our team. His skillset, background and work made him a real standout. We couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be more thrilled to have him join Zane in leading Emotive\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Creative Collective. Importantly, his appointment is a key step in our mission to assemble Australia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most diverse team of specialised creative talent. By working with a range of writers, directors, comedians, designers and beyond, our creative teams are uniquely tailored to the client\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This appointment follows a period of significant growth for the Sydney agency who announced their new strategic positioning and consumer centric creative process titled \u00e2\u0080\u0098Social to Scale\u00e2\u0080\u0099 late last year, which saw them expand into a full-service creative agency, delivering content, ads and experiences. Clare commences on Monday 6th May and will be based out of the Emotive Beach Haus in Sydney."

"Trusted 12:20 / 27.05.2019 Vox We should opt into data tracking, not out of it, says DuckDuckGo CEO Gabe Weinberg People don't realize just how much they're being tracked online, says DuckDuckGo CEO Gabe Weinberg \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but he's confident that once they learn how much tech companies like Google and Facebook are quietly slurping up their private data, they will demand a change. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey're getting purchase history, location history, browsing history, search history,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Weinberg said on the latest episode of Recode Decode with Kara Swisher. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd then when you go to, now, a website that has advertising from one of these networks, there's a real-time bidding against you, as a person. There's an auction to sell you an ad based on all this creepy information you didn't even realize people captured.\u00e2\u0080\u009d DuckDuckGo offers a privacy-minded search engine that has about 1 percent of the search market share in the US (Google's share is more than 88 percent), as well as a free browser extension for Firefox and Google Chrome that blocks ad networks from tracking you. But rather than waiting for a comprehensive privacy bill to lurch through Congress over many years, he's proposed a small, simple tweak to US regulations that might help: Make not being tracked by those networks the default, rather than something you have to opt into. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fact that consumers have already adopted it and it's in the browser is just an amazing legislative opportunity, just give it teeth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's actually a better mechanism for privacy laws because once you have this setting and it works, you don't have to deal with all the popups anymore. You just set it once, and then sites can't track you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You can listen to Recode Decode wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts , Spotify , Google Podcasts , Pocket Casts , and Overcast . Below, we've shared a lightly edited full transcript of Kara's conversation with Gabe. Kara Swisher: We're going to very quickly bring up Gabe, come on up, Gabe Weinberg. He's from DuckDuckGo. We're going to talk about the awfulness of Google now. Gabe Weinberg: Hello. This is Gabe. He's the founder and CEO of DuckDuckGo. This is another search engine, you do have a choice in this world, whether you know it or not. Yes, you do. All right. Gabe, we were just talking about inequity and wealth and stuff like that. Let's talk about inequity of information, because that's really what's happened. We have given over control of our information to one company, really, in this world. I'm going to tell one quick story before you start, so you get a sense of it. I was walking, in the early days of Google, with Larry or Sergey, I often can't tell them apart, and there was a room full of televisions, like a Circuit City. I looked in and they were all on, all these dozens of televisions. I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you doing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I think it was Larry, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe're recording all of television.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo we can figure out a way to search it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you gotten the copyright from those people to do that, have you actually reached out?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy should we do that, why do we need to do that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, because if you record it, then you'll have it recorded, then you'll have the search for it, and then nobody else can do it, and then you'll dominate it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He was like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cUh-huh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat's wrong to do that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He was like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOkay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and we moved on. It was a really interesting moment for me that they really were super interested in owning every piece of information on the planet. It was a revelatory moment for me. Talk about what we have now. Talk a little bit about DuckDuckGo first, about what you're trying to do, because you have been a search engine for how long? Eleven years. Right. Talk about what you do precisely and how it contrasts with Google. Yeah. DuckDuckGo is a general internet privacy company at this point, and we help you essentially escape the creepiness and tracking on the internet. We've been running this non-tracking search engine alternative to Google for 11 years. We're doing about a billion searches a month, it's about 1 percent of market share in the US now, fourth-largest search engine. Then we also operate a mobile browser and browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox that block trackers across the internet. As you're expressing, Google and Facebook are the largest purveyors of these trackers, but we block trackers from hundreds of companies, and then we also enable more encryption on the internet. When you go to a website, there's a http/https version. Sometimes sites have the unencrypted version and the encrypted version, but they send you to the unencrypted version, so we force you to go to the ... That's in order to follow you. Yeah. We force you to go to the encrypted version, which helps your ISPs stop from tracking you. It's all one download that just helps you escape tracking on the internet. Why did you decide to do this? Because a while ago, everyone was welcoming this idea of convenience. I think Margrethe Vestager said that to me , is that we've traded convenience for something better, and she was talking about search engines she uses in Europe that are different. Google's convenient, Google has mail, Google has maps, Google has this. I'm using that because you're in the search business. Why did you decide to do this in the first place? Well, I have a tech policy background, my graduate degree is in tech policy from MIT, and I originally got into search actually because I was interested in search, but immediately after launching it, I started getting privacy questions. This was well before Snowden still, 2008. So, I did my own investigation and found two really interesting things. One, searches are essentially the most private thing on the internet. You just type in all your deepest, darkest secrets ... Right, absolutely. ... and search, right? The second thing is, you don't need to actually track people to make money on search. Google still to this day, and there's been Congressional testimony ... actually, the hearing that I was at, the representative from Google said this, they still make most of their money off the same way DuckDuckGo makes money, contextual advertising, nothing to do with following you around. It's keywords on the search page. You type in \u00e2\u0080\u009ccar,\u00e2\u0080\u009d you get a car ad. And you can do that without tracking anybody, so what I realized pretty quickly is that's a better user experience, and just made the decision not to track people. At the beginning of that, that wasn't the main differentiator, because we weren't as aware of all the privacy harms, but as time has gone on, it's become the main driver for people to adopt DuckDuckGo. To adopt that. Talk about contextual advertising, because this is just a basic business, you type whatever. If you think about Google or what you are, search is like a database of human intentions, right? Yes. It's a great history of advertising, and I think it helps to explain the current market. It used to be the case, as you're saying, when the internet started all the way up until the mid-2000s, this contextual advertising was basically all advertising. On search, it was just the context of the page, but it was also the case on publisher sites. I'm sure you remember, sites used to sell their own ads, they would put advertising based on the content of the article. And then the mid-2000s, it switched to behavioral advertising, which is the creepy ads, the ones that kind of follow you around the internet. Two companies dominate that because they have all the data on people: Google and Facebook. But there's been no real proof that that is really better, and it's arguably way worse for the publishers who then have ceded all sorts of money to Facebook and ... Talk about that shift to behavioral advertising, because when you did it ... Years ago, at Google, also there used to be a ticker that used to run across when you entered Google about what people were searching for at that moment, and they stripped it of dirty stuff, which was quite a bit, apparently. But you would see things like \u00e2\u0080\u009chorses jam French,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and you'd be like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat the fuck is that person searching for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I would sit there and I'm like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't even understand that query.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Talk about how it shifted from that to the idea of behavioral. Why go there? What happened is you had publishers selling the biggest inventory, so the top of the page, banner advertising, and then they still wanted to make some more money, so they had ceded the bottom of the page to ad networks that didn't want to sell. Google's was the biggest, it was AdSense, based on a company they actually acquired. Called DoubleClick. Before that. Before DoubleClick. Yeah, the one before that, and then they acquired DoubleClick in 2007. Slowly, publishers ceded some of their page over to it, and then Google ended up having all this behavioral data, so if you searched for something, you could then follow people around with that search. Those advertisements became more lucrative, and then slowly, publishers ceded most of their page over to this behavioral advertising. However, my proposition is innovation in contextual advertising hasn't happened in the last 10 years, and it may be just as lucrative. You can imagine videos, articles, similarly parsing out what the real content of it is and putting ads just based on that, not based on you. There's been a little evidence of this after GDPR. New York Times, for example, got rid of all the behavioral advertising in Europe and saw an increase in revenue. Now, partly that's because they just got rid of the middleman, but partly that's because it actually is useful advertising. Like, you write an article on airplanes, and you have an airplane ad. Right. Why the shift then, to behavioral? Because they just decided to do it? Yeah. It's strategic for their companies, because if you think about their position, they're the ones with the data monopolies, so if they are going to run an ad network, they should run it based on behavioral because no one can compete with them on that. The real reason why that's enabled is because there's been no real regulation in tech that would have prevented that. No, there's zero regulation, right. There's the one from 230, but that's it. Right. Talk about 230. Do people know what Section 230 is? Well, those who don't, it's the Communications Decency Act, which I wrote about for the Washington Post 109 years ago, was an act that they put through, most of which was stripped out, most of the act was deemed ... It was started by people who were worried about dirty stuff on the internet, essentially. Within the Communications Decency Act was Section 230, which gave internet companies broad immunity from anything that happened on their platform, and it was designed so that these companies would be able to grow and not be sued to death, essentially, and their businesses would be able to ... They were small businesses at the time, and it continues to protect big companies like Google and Facebook [and] YouTube. And when you mention the idea of ... There's been some eking away at 230 around sex trafficking and some other things, but essentially, if you mention the idea of removing 230 to internet companies, they start immediately vomiting on their shoes because it would mean they would be subject to legal attacks, which would be unprecedented, presumably. Correct? Yeah. I think it's the specter of any regulation, right? Right. But the idea that there would be no regulation on digital forever is ridiculous. I mean, every other area of technology has regulation to pull back some of these externalities. So, I think it's inevitable, just a matter of what it looks like and when. All right. They moved to behavioral advertising. I want to get to that legislation in a second, because you were proposing your own legislation, correct? They get this behavioral information. Talk a little bit about what it does, because people are very unclear about what happens when this occurs. Essentially, these trackers exist across the web. When you go to a website like Recode, there are trackers hiding behind it. You think you're just interacting with the site you're on, but really, there are companies like Google and Facebook and many others slurping up your information and your browsing history. Through these various mechanisms, they're getting purchase history, location history, browsing history, search history, and when you add all that together ... And made more important by mobile because ... Yeah, exactly. It's harder to block stuff on mobile, you get location, much more granular. Some of these are sending like hundreds of data points a day, so you get a really robust profile of you, and then when you go to, now, a website that has advertising from one of these networks, there's a real-time bidding against you, as a person. There's an auction to sell you an ad based on all this creepy information you didn't even realize people captured. I think that's what people are finally starting to realize, and they've been going on the idea that they were just interacting with this one website, but once they find out that all this tracking is going on, they become incensed, effectively. Do you think people are actually mad? I do, yeah. Explain that to me, because a lot of the tech companies, they don't care about this, they don't care about privacy. I just interviewed Scott McNealy recently, who's a ... He's a famous one, yeah. He's famous for saying ... For \u00e2\u0080\u009cprivacy is dead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d No, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGet over privacy, you have none of it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have no privacy, get over it .\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yeah. Privacy is dead, get over it. We track this, like do national surveys very closely, and it's increased again and again and again of people, once they understand what's going on, they want to take action. There is a setting, which is part of the legislation that our legislation is based off, called \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo not track.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In your browser, in most browsers, if you delve into the privacy settings, there's something that says do not track, and our measurements \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and it's not just us, because Gizmodo measured their sites \u00e2\u0080\u0094 between 10 and 25 percent, depending on what you look at, people have enabled that setting. People are like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo one ever goes into settings and looks at privacy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That's not true. Literally, tens of millions of Americans have gone into their browser settings and checked this thing. So, people do care, and that has just climbed up and up and up as the knowledge of the tracking has gone on. Because before you knew about it, you were okay with it because you didn't realize it was so invasive, but after Cambridge Analytica and all the stories about the tracking, that number just keeps going up and up and up. One of the things a lot of people do bring up with me still, though, is, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I don't really care. I don't have much to hide. It doesn't matter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I get that all the time. Like, who cares if they know if I went to Best Buy and bought a, whatever I bought. Talk to why that might be not the best way to think about it. There's two answers to that. One is philosophical, in that privacy is a fundamental human right, and so you don't need to care or hide anything to exercise your rights. You wouldn't say that for speech. Just because you have nothing to say doesn't mean you should never have free speech. That's kind of on the philosophical side. On the harm side, there are some that people don't realize. A lot of people really don't like the creepy ads following them around. Some people seem to be fine with that. At a deeper level, there's this thing called the filter bubble, which is that recommendation algorithms, and in particular, search results, are tailored to you, and that means that you're not seeing what everyone else is seeing, and that actually distorts the democracy. That's a real harm to individual people and society. Then there's just the general identity theft and data breaches, which is happening over and over again, which is one of the main drivers for adopting stuff like DuckDuckGo. You've created legislation that you would like someone ... Model legislation, yeah. ... that you would like someone to submit to Congress. Explain what you want to do. This isn't a landscape of all the privacy legislation, and I would love to hear the nuance of it ... Now, just to understand, we do not have a national privacy bill in this country, at all. Other countries do, and much more stringent, like GDPR in Europe, but we don't have one. We have one in California that's ... CCPA. ... about to come online, but the lobbyists are trying to de-fang it rather substantively. There are 10 others in states across the country. There are certain states that are doing that, I think Louisiana has one. There's all kinds of states. Vermont has a data broker law. A lot ... Let's hope Alabama doesn't have one, but go ahead. Sorry, but Jesus Christ. All right. There's too much of a patchwork of them, correct, across the country, the idea. There's not a national bill. There's no national bill. We really should have a national bill like GDPR, but one of the problems with GDPR is how it's operationalized a lot of consent dialogs, and that's called notice and consent, and people just end up clicking the consent. We think a better mechanism is this thing that I was talking about earlier, this \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo not track\u00e2\u0080\u009d setting in the browser that tens of millions of people already put on, and the fact that consumers have already adopted it and it's in the browser is just an amazing legislative opportunity, just give it teeth. It's actually a better mechanism for privacy laws because once you have this setting and it works, you don't have to deal with all the popups anymore. You just set it once, and then sites can't track you. Should it be set from the beginning as \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo not track?\u00e2\u0080\u009d This is a debate, whether it should be default on or default off. I would love it to be default ... have to opt out of it, but I'd happy if it was opt in as well because I think people will ... Oh, people keep tripping here. Outside? ... the second trip. Hello, sorry. Okay. It was the same guy, okay. It's the same guy tripping, all right. Now he's just fucking with me. All right, go ahead, sorry. No worries. I think people will opt in ... He's Google. I don't care. I think people will opt in if they have the opportunity, and they can opt out of this tracking. What we're hoping is, there's two things. One, as you said, California's getting de-fanged, the California bill. As that happens, the pressure for a federal bill is going down this year because if it's all de-fanged, there's no pressure to pass something that preempts it. But still, all the people in the country really want something passed, so one option here is this would be a much simpler thing to pass. Just give a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo not track\u00e2\u0080\u009d mandate for no tracking for that setting. Much easier than comprehensive legislation. The other thing is that any comprehensive legislation that gets passed, do not track can be the mechanism. So, we're hoping that it gets added to any larger bill as the mechanism to help people opt out. Why do people have to opt out? Why do they have to opt into it, I guess, opt into it, because you don't have to opt into clean water, you don't have to opt into, like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think I'd like my water clean or dirty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It's kind of crazy, the stuff that consumers have to do in order to protect themselves compared to almost any other thing they use. You don't, again, opt in, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'd like the tires that don't fall off,\u00e2\u0080\u009d opt in, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'd like the food that isn't tainted, please.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Why is that mentality around? I think the mentality is around because of the lobbying that it would distort the advertising business model. I would love it to be opt in by default, but in a realistic way, I think if it was operationalized as a way to opt out, I think that would be effective because, as you said before, the other argument is some people don't care, and that gives people, really, the choice. That they just could leave it there? Yeah. How is it, operating against a site like Google or a big site where you're 1 percent? How do you do that? It's been interesting. We try to educate people about privacy and that there are alternatives. Our main issue is just not everybody knows about us. There's 20 percent of people that we think would be interested in switching to DuckDuckGo, but it's hard to convey all these privacy concepts. I'll give you an example. We've been talking about the filter bubble for years. In 2012, we ran a study on Google that we think influenced the 2012 election, that's how long ago it was, but nobody ... we had to speak for 10 minutes to explain what the filter bubble was back then. But after 2016, in the last two years, now we can talk about the filter bubble, just name it and people know what it is, generally. How many people know what the filter bubble is, I'm just curious? Explain the filter bubble. Well, it's the idea \u00e2\u0080\u0094 first of all, that percentage is very high, so I like that \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but it's the idea that for search in particular, as an example, when you search, you expect to get the results right? If you searched for gun control or abortion, you expect, we search at the same time right here, you would expect to get the same thing. But that's actually not what we found when we did a study on Google. Yes, there could be different search results. Yeah, and people don't realize that. So in addition, we found that it varies a lot by location, and so if you take that to the extreme, let's say that voting districts are getting different results for candidates or issues, it can skew the polarization of that district very easily over time. Because people who are undecided are actually searching for these topics, and people generally click on the first link, and if you're controlling that first link in that district, that's what people are going to learn about. So what do you ... Anand was just talking about the idea of people that shouldn't have this kind of power having this kind of power. How do you look at it? Because it's, it is a group of maybe 1,000 people making these decisions in Silicon valley pretty much, if that many. Recently, I did an interview with Tristan Harris and he was talking about, he called it the \u00e2\u0080\u009cclimate change of culture\u00e2\u0080\u009d is what we're going into. The only positive part about it is there are only 1,000 people whose minds you have to change on this. How do you look at that small amount of people making decisions for the entire world, really? What can we do about that? Yeah, I look at it structurally, and I think that on the consumer side that we've talked about, there needs to be a way to opt out, which would lower the power, right? On the kind of structural business side, at the core of this problem, at least the one that we were talking about here, is data monopolies, right? It's the collection of data profiles and there are ways to split those up. So some people are talking about extreme measures, which I'd be in favor of the spinning off companies, but there are other ways to do it, such as not allowing data to be shared between different business units. So if you're on Instagram and you are browsing something, that data cannot be shared and used on Facebook. Which was precisely the reason Facebook bought that company. Yeah. Right. That's why it should have been rejected in the first place. But at this point, one thing you could do is legislate, and as part of our proposal is that if you go to that site, you can't share data back to the other sites. So that would effectively add more competition and less power in these decisions. Except they sit next to each other. They happen to be on that same ridiculous campus they have, they share the same kombucha stand, so it's hard to ... That's why the argument for separating them more strictly is pretty solid. What about opening up their data, that they have collected? Both companies, for example \u00e2\u0080\u0094 because essentially we're talking about Facebook and Google pretty much, and Amazon's just starting to get into that business, the advertising business. It's two companies right now, correct? Yeah. In the digital advertising market, absolutely. The debate is kind of out on interoperability, which is what that is, it may help in the social network space. It's less important in the search space because, as I was saying earlier, you actually don't need these profiles to do good search results. They're really using search to do ads on YouTube and Gmail and all these other places, and so it could help in social networks to help someone start a social network and be able to switch all your friends a little quicker, but it probably wouldn't solve Google's problem. There hasn't been a major social network started since 2011. Which is amazing, if you think about that. There's a reason, because why do it? And then, and for the rest of it, I think it's just Snapchat, correct? [Evan Spiegel's] the chief product officer for Facebook right now, as far as I can tell, because they steal all his ideas. So how do you then shift that? How do you stop that? Just separating them? Which of the ways you think should happen? I really think you have to get to the core of this data monopoly. That's the key, and I think part of the problem actually has been that market definition, as people think of it as search markets, social network market. It's what you saw in Congress too, but it really is a digital advertising market, that's where the domination is. Right. So you have to change the digital advertising market. You can do that by putting in more Chinese walls between the companies. You could do that by doing something like do not track, which would force companies to be more contextual. So all of a sudden you'd be steering the industry back to the contextual from the behavioral, because 25 percent of people now would advertise on contextual, behavioral will be outlawed for them. So that would just break up the competitive advantage, basically, of the data profiles. When you have behavior, do you think that's even possible? Because the idea is adding more, with AI is adding more and more behavioral data in order to track you and accompany, in countries like China and other places, they're using that behavioral data very \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they're using a lot of it including facial recognition. The companies here I think are just dying to get into facial recognition and know the controversies around it. So it doesn't seem like backing away from behavioral, there's something, they seem to be doubling down in behavioral. That's why I believe you need government regulation in it, and to your point, you can look at China as an example, and so not only should you push things back to contextual, but you probably should have some lines, bright lines, that you can't cross in behavioral. Right? You saw San Francisco ban it the other day. This week San Francisco banned facial recognition software being used in the city. Is that correct? Yeah, that's right. For government. For government. Another good example, which isn't talked about that much, is political advertising on Facebook. So you know, there's ... Oh it's talked about a lot, yeah. Yeah, well not this part, there's this disclosure, but arguably there should be a ban on behavioral advertising to some level of people, just blanket for political advertising. To some level of people. What do you mean? Like 1,000 people or 10,000, you could pick your cutoff and then say you cannot target ads at a population less than that amount. Because what's happening now is the behavioral advertising just targeting you, right? Or a very small amount of people. And it's using, it's manipulative in two ways. You can manipulate the targeting, so I can select just the three or five people that I think would totally be triggered by this. You could also do A/B testing and change words and images to get like the perfect manipulation. Tristan Harris has better words for this, I forget what he says, but the brainstem ... Yes, that goes down the brainstem, yeah. Right, and that kind of stuff should be, probably, outlawed. Especially for political advertising. To individualized people? Yeah, but it manages individual probably at some threshold that's significantly high. They can make the argument, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh this is just like TV, our disclosures are going to be like TV.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Well, you can't target, well you might be able to eventually, which also should be outlawed, but in TV, you weren't targeting down to the individual person. Right, you were targeting great groups of people. Yeah. You also couldn't just put ads up the way they do on Facebook. Right, and do all this testing you couldn't do, you can't test 1,000 ads. So do you think our regulators are up to this task? So you're writing your own legislation, I'm assuming you're running your company at the same time and you don't, you're not a legislator? That's true. So how do you look at our legislators? Is there more strength elsewhere in the world or in this country? Let's talk just about this country, because I think most people saw the Facebook hearings. Yeah. Mark looked great in that hearing and he's not the most articulate of people. It's largely because most of the legislators looked so bad and looked so ignorant. So when you say Mark looks so good, it was because it was such a low, low bar that it was hard not to. I think they could have put a ham sandwich there, and it would have looked pretty good. But that said, I have talked to legislators who are quite smart. There's a lot of them in Washington, and especially in the regulatory agencies and elsewhere. What's the problem from a regulatory ... is it the money? These companies are throwing it at lobbyists, at them, or is it just a lack of will, or is it ignorance? How does that change? Right. So to answer your first question, there are very smart people there and just like running a company, they hire staff and there's lots of Senators who have hired really good tech staff, and there was a handful, maybe five to 10, and they're writing, they're trying to write some of this legislation. So I don't think you need the whole Senate writing it, for example. So I'm actually pretty encouraged in that regard, the level of thought that's been going into some of these proposals. I think that writing something like GDPR is complicated, Europe was doing it for 20 years, I mean, it was an update of a 1995 law and then they took five years to update it, basically. Right. So we're just getting started this year, so there is some amount of time that it will take. That's one reason we proposed this legislation, because you can do this right now. This is an easy thing you could do. Solving a lot of it all at once is difficult. I prefer to do it a little bit in piecemeal as opposed to just one thing and then be done. That's the other thing I don't really like about our government system is, we pass something and then we don't touch it for 20 years, which is what happened to the CDA. It would be better if we pass something every year or two and kind of tweaked it. So what do you imagine that they will do? You mentioned, of the many different things that are happening? Like right now the FTC is considering fining Facebook $5 billion, which I called a parking ticket. Yes, I agree with you. Thank you. I'm correct. Need another zero. Two zeros, actually, I've decided. That would do it. Two zeros would, yes, that would do it. But the "

"oncept is fining them. Taxing them is another way. Regulatory guardrails is another way, and breakup \u00e2\u0080\u0094 antitrust action, for presumably break up \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and then not letting them buy anything. Yeah. Of those things, what do you imagine is the most effective right now? I think not letting them buy things would be good. Right. Anything that gets at, if you're talking about Google and Facebook and the digital advertising market, anything that gets at the data monopoly would be good. Of those, breaking up could do it, China's wall could do it, do you not track could do it. All of those would do something. How much time do you imagine it will take? There is a techlash going on right now, and it's largely because of the 2016 election and the idea that the Russians were customers of these companies. When do you imagine ... do you imagine that will continue, or do you think it's gonna peter out? And the next then, how dangerous is it for the next elections that these continue to be issues? Do you think these companies have finally sort of come to Jesus and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh dear, we've made some errors here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I think you're seeing that because all of their announcements have just been centered around privacy, right? So they're feeling this is a real thing at this point. Maybe Scott McNealy is still saying that, but everybody else is now embracing at least the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cprivacy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d whether they mean it or not. Right. I think you're gonna see the techlash continue until people think there's some meaningful change. I worry about the breakup because that takes a really long time, historically. Right. Some of these other things can be done much quicker, so I'm hoping that something will get done quicker. I'm a little saddened by what's happened in California, because I think that's slowing things down. Right. But what I haven't heard anyone talk about, which is interesting, is that got started by a ballot measure, for people who don't know. Everything in California gets started like that. One person. Sure, just so you know. Yeah, one person did that. Yeah. There's nothing to stop somebody from doing it again if it gets watered down. That, someone put on something else. Yeah, or just put out the same thing again. Right. You know, if it gets totally watered down, just do the same thing. And yet we don't have privacy in place. So talk just very quickly, we just have a few more minutes. What can people do right now, besides using DuckDuckGo, what is some of the things they should be doing to protect themselves online and things that they don't realize they're being tracked \u00e2\u0080\u0094 besides, please, please don't buy one of their internet home devices. Yeah, that would be good. Yeah. My son goes around and unplugs them all in our house. Yeah, they don't work. They make lovely paperweights, but go ahead. Facebook is an interesting challenge. I haven't been a Facebook user for a long time, and there's plenty of studies that show that's a healthy choice. Yeah. But there aren't great alternatives to it, and so that one, I think you should leave, and a lot of people have. Just leave Facebook. Just leave it, yeah. For Google, there are actually alternatives in every category. So we're in search, but there's alternatives in emails, alternatives in ... Such as? ProtonMail is a big one, we use FastMail at DuckDuckGo, and in you know docs, there's things like Zoho, they're not all super private like us, but they're often paid, but cheap alternatives that put privacy first. So I would leave the services because the idea that alternatives don't exist is just nonsense. Well, although it's inconvenient because they all work together on your phones or whatever you have, they all seamlessly work together. You know, I've been out for a long time, but it's totally productive. I mean, you just click on a different app on your phone. They're on your home screen, you go into a different one. Okay. What else should people do to protect themselves? So in the devices themselves, there's a bunch of privacy settings that actually matter, and we have a blog at spreadprivacy.com with advice tips that we just, education, wrote it all up. There are things like you can turn off the ad tracking on a lot of ... on Apple, for instance, you can use encryption end-to-end. You could basically encrypt your \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Apple is by default \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but you can do your laptop. These are things that take like an hour, but you run through the checklist and then you're a lot more private. So encryption, encrypting your laptop. Yeah. Encrypting your phone or having a phone ... Encrypting everything, changing, basically doing all the opt outs you can do, which, we have a list and you can run through the settings. Then switching off of these services, kind of voting with your feet. What about mapping? So we use Apple Maps for our surface knowledge. They're such bad maps. They are \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they have gotten a lot better. I'm sure I would give them a try. All right. Okay. Because they're terrible maps. That's why, I mean, it's hard not to use a Google Map because they're so good. I would give them a try. Okay. All right. Anything else? Any other things? Those are the top ones, because I don't want to scare people that it's difficult. You know, it really is, you spend a few minutes on this and you can be out. I think people think it's such a gargantuan thing to leave these companies, and I don't think that's actually true. What about cameras and audio? Just so you know, when I was visiting Facebook I noticed Mark had his camera covered, had his audio covered, he had everything covered. Yeah, absolutely. When you, people conflate privacy and security a lot, but I totally agree. So on the security side you should definitely have a webcam cover and use two-factor authentication. You know that thing that texts you all the time, you should use that for all services. So most services that you have your ... your email is the most important, but you can set up this two-factor authentication much better because most of the hacks that have happened, a lot of the identity theft has all been from phishing on your email and you know, you click on something, type in your password, and two-factor authentication is just another layer that prevents that from happening. All right, and covering... When you get into things like facial recognition and other issues, as people start to use VR and AR and things like that, what would you advise people? Facial recognition is hard. There are ways to actually change, like wear things that change your face so you don't get captured by the cameras, but I think that ... Wear things and change your face? Yeah, you can like ... Mask, it's called a mask. But go ahead. Yeah, more minor things, I forget what it was, but you can like put like aluminum foil or something that freaks things out, but I'm not recommending that. You don't see me wearing it. I think the problem with facial is you're going to need laws with some of this stuff, and so San Francisco's great, starting the trend there. Okay. To not to \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not to use ... and companies not use facial recognition. Yeah. You're going to need, that one is going to need to be solved at a more societal level. Do you think people realize how much facial recognition is used in this country? No, not at all. There was a, the privacy project, the New York Times, I assume you're aware, there was a really interesting story two weeks ago where they took, I don't know if you read that one, they took camera ... You were part of that story? Yeah, no, that project, but go ahead. Oh yeah, so they took live webcam footage that was just on a camera and just put it up on Amazon with their facial recognition off-the-shelf stuff, and then were able to then identify a bunch of different people. They called them up and was like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw you walking here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It took $100 and like three hours. Right. Well, exactly. They also are using things much more seriously in workplaces to watch your face as you work, and also to decide whether to hire you based on your facial expressions. What they're trying to do right now, from what I understand, some of the new software will track your face and expressions during an interview and then match it to their top performers whose faces they were also tracking and therefore don't hire you if you're not one of their top performer's facial expressions. It's crazy. It's another area, just bias in algorithms in general. But this is to your earlier point, is that a central point about regulation is there's been no regulation for 20 years, right? So there's just a dearth of regulation. And you're not going to solve it in one shot. So this bias in algorithms probably needs to be a separate bill, right? AI in general, this area, facial recognition. We need to tackle these problems separately, but they are the biggest problems and so we should be doing it year after year. I worry that it's going to be a checkbox, that we pass something and then it's going to be done. We're just going to have to keep the pressure on. Do you ever imagine \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and then I'll get to questions from the audience \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that we'll ever escape the enormous power of something like Google? Because what it's become, it is the answer machine for everything, really. Even though you have 1 percent that's ... They have 90 percent everywhere. Yeah, I do. I think if we have these structural changes, I think you could see the market open up. We are a small company, we're only 55 people, and to be like \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you compete?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I mentioned earlier we use Apple Maps, right? We could debate how good they are. But in each of these verticals there are actually really good answers. So Yelp for restaurants, which we use. We use Wikipedia, just like Google does for ... But Yelp is getting crushed by Google, they've talked about it. Yeah, exactly. But it's not like their answers aren't good, right? So if the market opened up a bit, these companies could thrive more. And we use them and put together good search results just based on all these other companies. I think that the idea that they're this magic AI that no one can compete with I think is false. Because if you look around in all these categories, there actually are good alternatives. But given that the amount of money they have, the amount of money they make, and the fact that consumers like them, like using them. I think one of the issues around all these tech companies is Amazon's so great about delivery even though they're ruining the lives of retailers across the country. I'm sorry about that. Or causing people to have job ... Or their contractors are treated badly within the stores. But gosh, they delivered my iced tea really quickly and it's delicious. Or Google, they're a horrible monopoly and yet wow, they were fast on giving me that answer if so-and-so is alive anymore. Or whatever they decide. I always search people if they're dead or not, so go ahead. Trust in Facebook has precipitously dropped in the past year, and so I don't think it's inevitable that trust is always at high levels, even if people kind of like, come out of it. Right, trust in Facebook has dropped, usage has not. Yes, well that's because there has not been a great alternative, right? People don't necessarily believe or want to believe the healthiness of quitting. But trust itself has eroded. So I think trust could erode in these other companies as well. Are you worried about who runs these companies at some point? Because one of my worries has always been ... Many years ago, I wrote a story about Google trying to take over Yahoo search. I think I've talked about this before. It was going to get them 90 percent of the market at this point. Yahoo was still a substantively large search, did substantively large search business, and Microsoft was the third one. I was struck by, they can't have 90 percent. Why isn't our government stepping in to do something about that? That's a ridiculous amount of market share. So a line I wrote was, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt least Microsoft knew they were thugs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Google pretends they're all happy with their funny balls and their crazy eating habits and their weird clothes and stuff like that, but they're still, as adorable as they are, they're still just as evil as Microsoft was. So I was making that point and I think it was Eric Schmidt who called me up and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat's really mean, that you say we're thugs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I think you're worse than thugs because you don't know you're thugs. And you are thugs, and therefore you're worse than thugs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he was like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe're not thugs, we're really good people. We're really good people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI get that, but I can't imagine a world where you have a company of this much power over information. What if someone ... \u00e2\u0080\u009c Of course it's like three clicks to Hitler, but that's what I said. It was like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what if Hitler ran Google? What if someone who wasn't so nice ran Google?\u00e2\u0080\u009d And it was like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, they don't!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And I was like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, but what if they do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut they don't!\u00e2\u0080\u009d So are you worried about the concentration of power in the hands of, again, a very small amount of people? Yeah. Absolutely. I worry that you're basically saying they intend good, right? It's like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe road to hell is paved with good intentions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I believe, we did this filter bubble study that they did influence the 2012 election. Now, a lot of people on the left liked the outcome. What we found, by the way, was when you searched for stuff, we found this thing called magic keywords, where if you search for something, and you search for something subsequent, you would get extra results inserted based on the previous search. So \u00e2\u0080\u009cObama\u00e2\u0080\u009d was a magic keyword. So if you searched for \u00e2\u0080\u009cObama\u00e2\u0080\u009d and then \u00e2\u0080\u009cgun control,\u00e2\u0080\u009d you'd get three gun control results in the results. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRomney\u00e2\u0080\u009d was not a magic keyword. So all these people ... No, no he was not a magic keyword. Yeah. So all these people searched for Romney and Obama and there were tens of millions of extra Obama results inserted across the country for that entire run-up to the election. We don't know what that changed, but I presume it actually did change a lot. Because people were searching just random issues that they wanted to hear about and they were just getting Obama's take on it, not Romney's take. Do you believe that was purposeful? No, I don't. I think it's totally unintentional. Right. It was a result of the algorithm and they were questioned on it, and they were basically like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOops,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the answer was, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we created these magic keywords, Romney was less popular at the time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was a year before. And that just happened. But it was probably a tiny change that no one even knew about that had a big impact. Okay. Questions from the audience. Lots of them, let's start here. Audience member: Thanks for being here. I have a question about how this conversation could or should change once it moves from the digital world. So a lot of times when we talk about privacy, especially tonight, we're talking about digital-first problems, or problems that are because of digital-first companies. But specifically the advertising example, now we're seeing addressable advertising on TV, where you can be just as targeted as you are online in your TV screen. And that can change depending on who they think are in the room at that time. Yeah, and streaming. It's because of streaming. Audience member: Yeah. All of it. How does that conversation change now that it's not just digital and it's really everywhere? Gabe Weinberg: In a sense, it is digital because the streaming, the conversion from analog to digital on TV, is a digital conversion, it just doesn't feel digital because it doesn't look like you're browsing the internet. But a lot of it is still going over the internet. So if you had something like do not track it could apply to all of these mechanisms, as long as it remains digital. So I think it would apply to that situation, as well as the billboards. You know, there's been talk about individualized billboards. Well, you saw the Tom Cruise movie, Minority Report , right? They clicked his eyes and then it says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHello, Mr. Nakamura. Would you like more fleece culottes?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Or whatever the heck he wanted last time. Audience member: Well, addressable ads from cable boxes, that comes through the data that cable companies have. Doesn't necessarily ... I mean, yes, if you probably could have some digital information coming and bleeding into that, but it's grown ... Well, they want to get the same information Google gets. Cable companies and telcos now are able now to get the kind of ... Because they're like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf they can get it, why can't we get it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d And usually telcos were prohibited from getting that kind of ... And the point is, you're right, if they get it, why don't we get it? Gabe Weinberg: Yeah, I agree with your premise that they're trying to copy the tracking business model everywhere to compete. And if it's outlawed in one place, it should be outlawed everywhere. Yep. Next question. Oh, you had one here, you didn't ... Audience member: I have a silly question. Okay. Audience member: Why'd you name it DuckDuckGo? That's a good question! That's not a silly question. Gabe Weinberg: Hi. It is a good question, and I wish I had a good answer, yeah. I do know the answer to that, but go ahead. Gabe Weinberg: Which I don't. It's a really fun game. Gabe Weinberg: Yeah. Duck Duck Goose. Audience member: It was a good question then. Gabe Weinberg: Yeah. It is. Go ahead, go ahead, you had no ... That's exactly it. Where were you? You were sitting there and going, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, it's either going to be like Blue Geese or Duck Duck Go?\u00e2\u0080\u009d What? So I was on a walk with my wife. Okay. Pre-even having a company, and I was going to start something, and I was like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat's a cool name.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And didn't know what the company was. Who thought of the name? Me. Just popped in my head. Okay. All right, all right, there you have it. All right, next. Right here. Audience member: Do we have the right to be forgotten, and should we have the right to be forgotten? Good question. Gabe Weinberg: We currently don't in the United States. It's part of GDPR and it's something we comply with. It's an interesting question of where to draw that line, and it hasn't been one taken up very much in the US yet. Because of the First Amendment. Gabe Weinberg: Yeah. It's never going to happen here. Audience member: So then if you were going to write an amendment, what would the amendment be to make the right to be forgotten? Gabe Weinberg: You would probably need a constitutional amendment, because of the First Amendment. Yeah. To change the First Amendment. That's not happening. But the idea is whether you want it or not, too. If there's good and bad information about a good person, a bad person could take down good information about them. So it gets into really thorny issues. The same thing around editing tweets, right now. That's their excuse. There's lots of ways they could do it, by the way, they could keep ... Audience member: Well, it's also like check the box. So if someone has a history and they've paid their debt to society, should they keep getting that time and time again and not being able to move past it? Yeah. Well, you know, they're not going to change that. But the line from the movie The Social Network , where it's, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe internet's written in indelible ink.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So it's an excellent question, I just don't think, because of the First Amendment, that it will ever get any traction here. I think every single thing you do online, every drunken college picture, is going to stay there for ... Gabe Weinberg: I haven't heard anyone talking about that here. What, drunken college pictures? I don't have any, I'm really old. Go ahead, right here. Audience member: How are we going to help the advertisers who are getting progressively more and more addicted to data, and have built these really robust data sets, even without the Googles and the Facebooks of the world? Yeah, they have Axiom, others. Audience member: Yeah, you can work with Axiom, and you can get lookalikes, you can deliver to them digitally or traditionally. So the issue, I wonder, is also the advertisers, the P&amp;Gs of the world, who are paying, and they're the ones who are subsidizing and encouraging this by paying for the ads? Gabe Weinberg: Yeah, data's starting to come out about this. The data so far is that they're paying for a lot more for not much. Behavioral advertising has not been that effective. Audience member: But they don't necessarily believe that that's true. Gabe Weinberg: Right. I agree we need empirical evidence a lot, but I think once they realize that they haven't been getting much for what they've been paying for, they're totally happy to embrace contextual advertising again. They've also given up their relationship with the consumer. Yeah, I had a really interesting conversation with the CTO of Ford , and I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat's your biggest problem?\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, the internet companies want to suck every bit of data and chomp it back out, and we want a relationship with the consumer over time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They have a very different mentality towards their consumers because they buy things from them. And essentially Google and Facebook are pass-throughs. They don't care about you. So it'd be interesting to see if they can regain power, because you're right, it's not effective for P&amp;G. They do start to realize this, I think they ... Gabe Weinberg: They don't have any agency right now. Audience member: And will they be upset because of the lack of transparency? Sorry. That's okay. Audience member: It's a very interesting subject. Yeah, it is. And the question is will these big advertisers ... The problem is the big advertisers are also getting disrupted by an Amazon. Like Amazon's selling all their Amazon goods. Audience member: Including advertising. Yes, everything. Yeah. Yeah, we didn't even talk about Amazon. Gabe Weinberg: Yeah, right now they don't have a lot of choice because all the audience, if you want to reach billions of people, you've got to go to Google and Facebook. But if they're ... And Amazon. Gabe Weinberg: Yeah, and Amazon. But if it's broken up a bit and contextual is back, there can be other ad networks that aren't Google and Facebook. Because they are the only road. Okay, any more questions? Last one, right here. Audience member: Can there be a DuckDuckGo for YouTube? Can there be a DuckDuckGo for YouTube? It's a good question. It is one category which I didn't hit on that doesn't have a great answer, honestly, right now. And there are great sites to put your video on. So Vimeo is a good example that I use for privacy with my kids' videos. But unfortunately, if you're a creator, all the eyeballs are on YouTube. It's another network effect. So to break that network effect is very difficult. It's impossible. There's no other choice, and the expense of doing it is so high. So they can create monopolies without creating monopolies, which is really the question for our legislators. Yeah, that's another legislative question we didn't address, but that one's an argument for treating it as a utility at that point. If it's such a natural monopoly that nothing can really compete with it, you need to regulate it as a utility. Or change law. Or change the way we do antitrust law. I think there's interesting people like Lina Khan and others that are talking about how to change the idea of what a monopoly is, and it doesn't have to cause consumer harm. In fact, it could have consumer good. You all like all the freebies you get from all these companies. You really do. That's the problem here, it's not harmful to consumers. Except it is. It's harmful to society. But it's not ... Well, there's an interesting argument. There was another New York Times article from Brian Chen who left Facebook, and he saw ... It's one anecdote, but it was interesting. He saw his purchases go down by 50 percent on his credit card. So you can say, well, he wasn't seeing a lot more ads, right? Because he wasn't on Facebook seeing all the ads. And that's definitely part of it. But some part of it was also because the ads were probably manipulative, and they were kind of manipulating him into buying stuff. So that's arguably a direct consumer harm. It was money out of his pocket he wouldn't have spent otherwise from being manipulated. Addictiveness, which is something a lot of people are talking, this ... I mean, I don't use Instagram. I don't use any of these services, by the way. But I was on Instagram the other day, and I was like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must buy that strange little object that they're ... \u00e2\u0080\u009c I don't know what it was, it was some bra that was better than other bras, and it was not. But it was weird, and I don't know what it was doing to my brain. I was fascinated. Yeah, they probably ran a thousand ads on that thing to like ... It was weird. ... get the exact emotional triggers. I didn't buy it. But I was this close. Close. Close, but not quite. So close. Anyway, thank you so much, Gabe.

"Trusted 14:36 / 27.05.2019 CNN Even as self-driving cars take to the road, drivers will still be in high demand By Gad Levanon and Frank Steemers for CNN Business Perspectives Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Gad Levanon is the chief US economist at The Conference Board. Frank Steemers is an associate economist at The Conference Board. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own. For the short term, however, those fears are overblown. Through at least the next decade, human truck drivers, bus drivers and taxi drivers will remain in strong demand. And during that time, self-driving technology will put little, if any, dent in that demand. What accounts for drivers being such a hot commodity? Labor shortages have afflicted a broad swath of blue-collar industries, including the transportation sector. Simple economics explains the gap: Demand exceeds supply. And in this case, by huge margins. Several factors have diminished the supply of available workers. According to our own calculations based on microdata from the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey , the transportation industry employs a relatively large share of older workers, who are steadily leaving the workforce. Meanwhile, as these Baby Boomers retire in droves, the industry struggles to recruit enough workers to replace them. As an increasing number of young people pursue college degrees, they're shying away from such blue-collar work and flocking to white-collar jobs. The prospect of a future economy saturated with driverless cars and trucks probably isn't helping either. After all, why start a career in a job that AI may someday obviate? And then there are drug-testing requirements. Such rules reduce the number of prospects who can pass the needed test for working in some transportation jobs. It's not that the tests have become more stringent. Finding workers who can pass them has become more of a hurdle simply due to the number of states that have decriminalized or legalized marijuana . At the same time the supply of drivers has decreased, the demand for them has substantially increased. The swell of e-commerce accounts for much of the growing demand. For example, the ever-growing Amazon needs thousands of warehouse workers to store and package its products, and thousands of drivers to transport its products. Case in point: Our own analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data found that from 2013 to 2018, employment in the transportation and warehousing industries increased by over 20%, vs. 9% across the total economy . This combination \u00e2\u0080\u0094 strong demand and weak supply \u00e2\u0080\u0094 has spelled good news for drivers: The Bureau of Labor Statistics' employment data shows that transportation and material-moving occupations \u00e2\u0080\u0094 crane operators, tractor operators, gas station operators and hand packagers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 boast an unemployment rate of 4.7% in the past year, the lowest since 2000 when the BLS started tracking consistent and comparable data for these occupations. And these days, not only are more of these workers employed; their wallets are bigger, too: Through the first quarter of 2019, wages for transportation and material-moving workers in the private sector grew by 4.2% . Shortages in transportation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which we expect to persist for at least the next decade \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are forcing companies to rethink their recruiting strategies. Among other steps, that means hiring beyond their typical pools of candidates. Businesses are now hiring more women in traditionally male-dominated sectors such as transportation and material-moving. Based on microdata from the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey, our own calculations find that since 2016, women have accounted for about 50% of the employment growth in these occupations. As a result, they now make up nearly one in five workers in these jobs. But what is good for drivers is less so for the sectors that rely on them. Rising labor costs are prompting price increases in transportation and warehousing goods and are expected to chip away at corporate profits. To some degree, these higher costs will be passed to consumers. Moreover, these ripples are impacting a wide swath of industries beyond just transportation and warehousing companies. In waste collection , for example, transportation and material-moving workers make up 70% of workers. Wholesalers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially those specializing in food and beverages \u00e2\u0080\u0094 also employ many drivers. And so do retailers that haul furniture, along with mining and manufacturing companies. In the past three years, the number of workers added to transportation and material-moving occupations was roughly equal to the number of workers added to all other blue-collar occupations combined. The growing need for transportation workers will also create pressure in industries with high demand for workers without a college degree that are capable of performing physically demanding labor, including manufacturing, agriculture and construction. Down the line, employers will be eager to take advantage of cheap, automated labor. But until that day comes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and it is probably still far away \u00e2\u0080\u0094 human workers literally and figuratively will remain in the driver's seat.

"AI Phones, PCs Edging Into Global Consumer Technology Organizers of the Computex Taipei show with 1,685 exhibitors -- including a who's who of global high tech companies -- call artificial intelligence one of their top 2019 themes. Microchip developers Intel, Nvidia and Qualcomm are expected to talk up their latest gear during the four-day show that opens Tuesday. Memory chip maker Micron Technology says it will exhibit a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbroad portfolio of memory and storage\u00e2\u0080\u009d for artificial intelligence. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy personal expectations toward AI this year are quite high,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Helen Chiang, general manager of market research firm IDC in Taipei. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhether from the perspective of the information systems or the technology, I've got some anticipation for these device-plus things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Artificial intelligence -- AI for short -- lets computers make human-like decisions based on data collected from hardware. Classic examples available to common users now include speech recognition, e-mail spam filters and personal assistants such as Siri and Alexa. Apps, speakers and 3D images Almost all the world's chief hardware and software developers say they are researching what they else can do with AI. That push promises more functions that will be built into PC operating systems and mobile phone apps. Forrester Research, a leading industry advisory firm, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach a market value of $1.2 trillion per year by 2020 as investment triples from 2018. Consumers should expect in the short term to find AI-assisted matchmaking apps, more chatbots used by financial services companies to talk with customers, and new tools for processing financial data, said Jamie Lin, founding partner of AppWorks Ventures, a startup accelerator in Taipei. One app designer is working with a Taiwanese smartphone company on AI technology that would turn camera images into 3D scenes, Lin said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPretty soon you're going to see phone device ODMs (developers) coming to the market where phones that are able to capture 3D images are loaded with software to help you turn that 3D image into content that can be used for different formats, for example games or 3D playbacks of sceneries,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Among AI-enabled hardware, \u00e2\u0080\u009csmart\u00e2\u0080\u009d speakers are especially likely to reach mass markets next year, Lin added. Consumers will be able to ask them questions such as the day's weather forecast or the latest NBA scores, he expects. Speakers already make up the highest growth category among \u00e2\u0080\u009csmart home devices\u00e2\u0080\u009d because of their \u00e2\u0080\u009ceasy\u00e2\u0080\u009d voice interface, Forrester said in a May 21 report. The rapid expansion of AI consumer products may not last. The market research firm Gartner forecasts that growth in the business value of artificial intelligence will slow through 2025 from a peak of 70 percent to just 7 percent as companies end up seeking \u00e2\u0080\u009cniche solutions that address one need very well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But the show host Taiwan is forecasting a boom for now. Premier Su Tseng-chang said in mid-May the government would help train 10,000 people every year to work in AI research and development. Taiwan, a global tech hardware hub since the 1980s, already has enough engineering knowhow to draw big-name Silicon Valley firms such as Google and Microsoft to open local R&amp;D centers. Computex 2019 Among the Computex exhibitors, Microsoft will show AI-enabled software and applications, said Mark Linton, general manager for Microsoft's partner-devices unit. AI features included in its Office 365 software already direct the PowerPoint program to make downloaded images \u00e2\u0080\u009cgel\u00e2\u0080\u009d into its presentations, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere's no doubt that AI is a transformative area of the technology industry, and over time it will prove to be a major investment area for Microsoft and I think the industry as a whole,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Linton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd really the benefits that we're looking to get there is to make systems and applications smarter, more intuitive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A lot of AI-linked gear is expected to surface this year at the show's InnoVEX segment. This zone for startups grew last year to 388 exhibitors, and 456 have registered for the event this week. Gartner anticipates that startup firms working with AI will overtake Amazon, Google, Microsoft and IBM this year in \u00e2\u0080\u009cdriving the artificial intelligence economy\u00e2\u0080\u009d for businesses. The Taipei show, now in its 38th year, expects to draw 5,508 exhibition booths, up nearly 10 percent over 2018. The number of exhibitors should rise 5%, the organizer said in a pre-show statement.

"Trusted 13:54 / 27.05.2019 Deadline BBC &amp; Channel 4 Reveal How Growth Of Netflix &amp; Amazon In The UK Has Lead To Rising Production &amp; Talent Costs British broadcasters BBC and Channel 4 have revealed that the rise of SVOD services including Netflix and Amazon has lead to rising production and talent costs in the UK television sector. The rising cost of drama production has been laid out by both broadcasters in their submission to the House of Lords Communications Committee Inquiry on Public Service Broadcasting In The Age Of Video-On-Demand. C4 highlighted the fact that the average budget for its drama has risen by over 100% in the last few years from \u00c2\u00a3725,000 per hour in 2013 to \u00c2\u00a31.5M in 2017. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is particularly driven by an increase in costs of production crew,\u00a0as a result of\u00a0increased demand and high tariffs from other content producers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it noted in its submission. The broadcaster added that it responded to these increased costs by co-producing with international operators, including with the likes of Netflix. However, it added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe do not believe it is appropriate for Channel 4 to develop co-productions for all its titles, given the likelihood for co-producers to want stories that are likely to have a more global appeal, and we believe it is important that UK-specific stories do not get diluted. We also know that longer-term concerns have been raised by high-profile talent such as Peter Kosminsky about whether we and the other public service broadcasters are becoming increasingly priced out of the market, particularly in genres like drama.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Netflix and Amazon's European growth has also caused issues with the demand for skilled production crew and studio space. C4 said that the SVOD services \u00e2\u0080\u009cshould play their part in addressing\u00e2\u0080\u009d this and called for these companies to \u00e2\u0080\u009ccommit to some level of transparency and reporting of their activity in the UK\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Similarly, the BBC claimed that the SVOD services \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay present long-term challenges to the established business models for producers\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the UK as well as an increase on talent costs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe changes in the market have resulted in more fluidity across the sector in terms of talent. Talent development and idea creation is essential and, with the increased opportunities available from SVODs, the cost of talent, on and off screen, has inflated,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it noted. The BBC has been increasingly co-producing its scripted slate with the SVOD with titles including Neil Gaiman's forthcoming adaptation of Good Omens with Amazon. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCo-production investment has been an important source of funding for the BBC's programmes.\u00a0 It has helped us to continue to commission programmes which, due to significant cost inflation, might not be possible for the BBC to finance alone given constrained public service budgets,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHowever, working with SVODs presents the BBC with challenges, including the risk that the BBC and other PSBs are cut out of future opportunities as SVODs increasingly seek to fully fund commissions, working directly with established talent and producers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The issue of attribution has also come up again. Channel 4 has been particularly vocal on this topic with its Netflix co-production The End Of The Fxxking World, which it noted was \u00e2\u0080\u009ccommonly perceived by both press and audiences as being a Netflix \u00e2\u0080\u0098Original' show\u00e2\u0080\u009d. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe importance of retaining brand attribution is a key strategic focus for Channel 4 going forward, and we are investing significantly in marketing to ensure that our programmes and our brand cut through with\u00a0audiences. Where we negotiate co-productions directly with the SVOD platforms, we are ensuring that our brand stings are \u00e2\u0080\u0098burnt in' to the beginning of shows once they appear on these services and the programming tiles that viewers scroll through attribute the shows to us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it added. While series such as Derry Girls and Catastrophe are described as \u00e2\u0080\u0098original' SVOD shows, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdespite merely being an acquisition\u00e2\u0080\u009d, it noted that as a public service broadcaster it had to following formal reporting requirements as to what is original versus acquired content. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would not be possible under this regulatory regime to classify acquired shows such as\u00a0Homeland,\u00a0The Handmaid's Tale\u00a0or\u00a0The Good Place\u00a0as \u00e2\u0080\u0098Channel 4 Originals' just because we have the UK rights to show them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it noted.

"Trusted 9:00 / 27.05.2019 FastCompany Will robots ever be better caretakers than humans? At the Aging Into the Future conference, a tech expo dedicated to innovation in elderly care, dozens of interactive booths beckoned investors, healthcare specialists, and senior citizens. There was a stationed driverless car, VR tutorials, and hands-free orthopedic shoes that open and close on their own. But only one booth boasted a line\u00e2\u0080\u0093specifically of silver-haired attendees. They stood patiently, every so often oohing and aahing over the featured device. Some turned to strangers, remarking, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIsn't this just the cutest?\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat's just incredible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Others asked when they could purchase their own. One by one, they excitedly approached the booth's star attraction: Tombot's Jennie, a robotic Labrador retriever puppy who moves and nuzzles just like the real thing. It doesn't pee, eat, or even bark. All this fake furry thing does is cuddle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople really respond to it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Tombot founder Thomas E. Stevens. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it's not a toy. It's a medical device providing a health benefit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tombot is one of many startups selling robotic companions for senior citizens, offering emotional support, day-to-day assistance, or remote monitoring through artificial intelligence. Though they are met with some enthusiasm from consumers and medical experts alike, these companies find themselves navigating a host of complicated issues:\u00a0How do we best design robotic devices to take care of aging populations and encourage adoption? What is the balance between creating something that is genuinely helpful, without it feeling creepy? Can robots ever truly replace human caretakers? Desperate times There are currently 46 million senior Americans\u00e2\u0080\u0093a number that is expected to double by 2050 as they grow to 22% of the population, according to the Pew Research Center. The U.S. healthcare system is bracing for a shortage of caretakers, nurses, and medical professionals. Add in a strict immigration policy and low birth rate , and some would argue it makes sense to therefore depend on technology\u00e2\u0080\u0093and as such, little robot helpers. \u00e2\u0080\u009c There aren't people around to give care,\u00e2\u0080\u009d notes\u00a0Deborah Carr, an aging expert and author of Golden Years?: Social Inequality in Later Life. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe're getting to this point where desperate times require desperate measures.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Elder care robots have flourished in places like Japan, which has the world's oldest population. In the United States, senior citizens may rely on mobility aids or an Amazon Echo as they age. Google Home and Amazon Alexa advertise a lot to the elderly showing the breadth of their technologies' use. That's important because not all older adults are the same, explains Carr.\u00a0Some want help with medications, others just want to know the weather or sports scores. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe often think of older adults as one population\u00e2\u0080\u0093there are actually many varied populations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Carr. Leda Rosenthal, founder of Alz You Need, a technology discovery platform that connects family caregivers with dementia assistive technology, sees an emerging aging tech market still in the early stages of designing products for various sub-groups. Most of these startups are not even seed-funded. For the most part, families generally rely on common tech cleverly applied to aging, like meditation apps such as Calm and Headspace, or Facebook support groups. One aspect Carr sees again and again is adults' desire to maintain independence, noting, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit's still very strong among older adults,\u00e2\u0080\u009d especially those of the Greatest Generation who pride themselves on being strong and resilient. They don't necessarily want to depend on their children, but they do need help, and many of them are lonely. More than a quarter of women aged 65 to 74 lived alone in 2014, and that number jumps to 42% for those aged 75 to 84, and to 56% among women ages 85 and up. Those kind of statistics inspired Israeli-based startup Intuition Robotics to create ElliQ, a smart robotic companion that engages its user throughout the day. That includes appointment reminders, assisting in video calls to family, suggesting a walk, or just by bringing the outside world in through random facts or funny videos. Marketed as the \u00e2\u0080\u009csidekick for happier aging,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it looks like a cross between Wall-E and a sleek coffeemaker. It's cute enough to elicit warm feelings, yet its shiny exterior very much connotes artificial intelligence. ElliQ is personalized, sensing how much its host wants to engage with it and what it prefers as their time progresses. The little guy was designed for older adults who are still active and want to remain so. Studies have shown that once people fall into loneliness, issues such as depression, dementia, and increased mortality rapidly accelerate, says Dor Skuler, CEO of Intuition Robotics. To make it effective, the team understood it had to feature the right kind of personable yet efficient design. ElliQ will endearingly bob its head up and down when its excited and apologize by sorrowfully looking down. If a loved one sends a photo, it will curiously look it over. It's meant to feel lifelike, with an expressive nature and intuitive body language. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe looks at you, lights up, has sound effects and content on the screen, and chooses what to say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Skuler. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat curated combination\u00e2\u0080\u0093from a timing and movement perspective\u00e2\u0080\u0093makes it feel like it's almost alive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Balancing reality The robotics category has long posed existential questions about the role technology should play in our lives.\u00a0 There's been much debate around the concept of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cuncanny valley\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093the\u00a0relationship between how much a product resembles a human and how eerie it seems, as a result. This spans multiple categories, such as lifelike dolls, virtual reality, and even computer animation. Anthropomorphic robots can feel oh so familiar and hence, often inspire revulsion or confusion; other times, an unnatural connection.\u00a0Ethically, what's the balance between emulating lifelike beings and creating a wholly false dependency? In the case of robotic companions, this proves especially challenging considering that such products are constructed to work intimately with their users\u00e2\u0080\u0093on a daily basis. Some startups veer towards human-like or\u00a0cartoon-ish appearances designed to seem overly friendly and cute. GenieConnect has saucer-like eyes and penguin-like arms that seem more Nickelodeon than elegant. Likewise, Blue Frog Robotics' fully mobile Buddy the Robot features oversize anime eyes and exaggerated childlike facial expressions. A Blue Frog Robotics rep says Buddy was made to establish empathy with the user, thereby creating an emotional bond. The company says their research found that to overcome fear and skepticism of a robot in the home, it needs to look friendly. Inspired by the Japanese \u00e2\u0080\u009cKawaii\u00e2\u0080\u009d culture of cuteness, they designed Buddy with elements taken from lovable characters of science fiction movies, such as Star Wars. Intuition Robotics, however, clearly fashioned ElliQ as a sleek consumer electronics device with a robotic voice. ElliQ has no hands or face\u00e2\u0080\u0093not even eyes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don't want to confuse the older adults in thinking that it's anything more than it is, or creating the wrong expectations on the intelligence of the system or the fact that it is an electronic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d stresses Skuler. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's not a dog, and it's not a person. So why would we pretend that it is?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Intuition Robotics tapped Fuseproject founder and designer Yves B\u00c3\u00a9har to craft a robot that infused the charms and strong persona of the Pixar lamp but didn't fall into the toy or gadget territory. It had to be elegant and easily blend into someone's home without screaming technology. It would embody subtle movements, not the exaggerated tones of something overly cutesy. Basically, they didn't want to infantilize their audience. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe opportunity here is to design robots that really serve people that tend to be not served well by technology\u00e2\u0080\u0093and aging is certainly one of those categories,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says B\u00c3\u00a9har. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe landed on this notion of a beautiful table-top object that reacts when they enter the room but doesn't intrude or take over the environment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d B\u00c3\u00a9har was adamant: he would not craft a device that would be an emotional crutch. ElliQ is therefore more reflective of a healthy relationship with something practical, something that you enjoy, he says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut not something that you are emotionally dependent upon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To each their own robot Independent seniors might not go for the creepy realism of \u00e2\u0080\u009cuncanny valley,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but what about those suffering from neurological\u00a0diseases or severe medical conditions? The overly realistic model might just serve those in desperate need of emotional care, even if it's battery operated. Tombot's furry Jennie, for example, is designed specifically to meet the needs of seniors with dementia in nursing care. It's estimated there are about 15 million American seniors that either have dementia or have pre-dementia mild cognitive impairment. Baby Boomers could spark a 75% increase in nursing home care, hitting 2.3 million by 2030. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe're not targeting healthy seniors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Stevens. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe're building things for people who don't have a choice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Researchers believe the majority of those diagnosed with dementia can physically and psychologically benefit by forming an emotional attachment, be it to an object or an animal. Pet ownership rates, however, plummet after age 75 because many seniors cannot physically care for a live animal. Tombot worked with animatronics experts at Jim Henson's Creature Shop to design a realistic robot puppy that would melt senior citizens' hearts. The company's founder says he also surveyed hundreds of senior citizens to better understand their tech preferences. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt came down to one simple thing: realism,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Stevens, noting they nixed cartoon-like appearances. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey prefer a realistic texture and feel. But most importantly, they prefer realistic behaviors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The fluffy puppy doesn't walk (that would make him easy to trip over), but he does contain multiple sensors for an autonomous and interactive petting experience. Unlike competitor products, which are more or less mechanical toys, Tombot is designed to emulate the actual anatomy and movement capability of live animals. He understands voice commands and will orient toward sound. Tombot can also feel where and how it's being touched, sensing the difference between a vigorous pet and being held. The behaviors are randomized, which adds to its sense of discovery. (It's software is updatable so it will continuously expand and improve behaviors.) \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe dog is choosing what to do at a given time, as to not resort to the same behaviors over and over again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Stevens. Tombot's early findings showed that seniors actually prefer the robots to live animals. That's because real dogs choose when to interact with humans, whereas these residents could choose when to interact with a robot. Already, says Stevens, numerous assisted-living facilities, senior day care centers, and an unnamed hospital chain intend to purchase their product for their members. Tombot is available for pre-order at $449 and will ship in March 2020. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you group all the tech into one category and say this is for seniors, you'll understand why so many products never get off the ground,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Stevens. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe're focused very specifically on the problem of people with issues that can't care for a live animal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Drawing in the consumer ElliQ's marketing centers around empowerment, stressing how devices can enrich lives and help seniors overcome the digital divide. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we started this company, we were very much struck by how much of the messaging in the elder space is around almost like catering to the fear and guilt of the adult children,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Skuler. \u00e2\u0080\u009c[When it comes to technology], 99.9% percent of the time, it's just a loved one living far away from you and maybe being alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d ElliQ primarily targets caregivers, the adult children responsible for their parents who need something a little more helpful than an iPad. They're the ones who purchase mom and dad a new gadget. Tombot, meanwhile, focuses on healthy seniors by explaining how the product can help maintain well-being and cognitive decline. Messaging is key, explains Carr. While Boomers increasingly adopt new technologies, there are still those who are skeptical\u00e2\u0080\u0093and downright resentful. Some refuse to email because they think it will substitute a phone call where they hear their grandchild. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's reframing how we talk about technology,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Carr, noting the need to push the argument for individual independence. It's not about asking them to \u00e2\u0080\u009crely\u00e2\u0080\u009d on a device but \u00e2\u0080\u009cenabling\u00e2\u0080\u009d them to safely live alone and have a richer social life. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's not a substitute for human contact\u00e2\u0080\u0093it helps facilitate that engagement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The same goes for advertising to the adult children, many of whom are wracked with guilt over the idea of passing off caretaking to technology. That mentality will change over time, says Carr, just as the public ultimately embraced the automobile or the telephone; the benefits soon outweigh the fears. A \u00e2\u0080\u009ccruel\u00e2\u0080\u009d replacement? Such sentiments, though realistic, are not without criticism. Dr Lee Kai-Fu, an artificial intelligence expert and former head of Google China, has publicly lambasted the use of AI to care for older populations, specifically in regard to emotional capabilities. Children should be subject to elderly care, he insists, with professional caretakers the next best thing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cElderly people really want to connect with other people and I think giving them primitive, fake, inanimate and non-emotional robots to interact with is a cruel thing that we should not do as human being,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he recently stated in an interview. There are also those who ponder the effects of robots on the elderly, especially in the absence of any long-term studies.\u00a0 Can we put our faith in such new technologies? What about privacy concerns? How will it impact users in the long run? Intuition Robotics is currently embarking on a clinical research study regarding the relationship between human and social robots. The startup partnered with the Centre for Aging + Brain Health Innovation to examine how robotic companions decrease the feeling of loneliness and isolation in seniors. Based on what he's seen with his hundreds of test subjects, Skuler remains optimistic. He recalls ElliQ owners talking about the product not simply as a device but almost as a new entity in their lives. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome people use the word presence, some say entity, companion, or sidekick,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says, musing, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit's part device and part alive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Still, it's too early to say how this nascent industry will shake out. Will even the best designed robots be adequate substitutes for human care? There's plenty riding on that answer. Japan, a leader in the robotic service sector, expects its domestic industry alone to grow to nearly $4 billion annually by 2035 . Carr believes that despite some of these products' predicted issues, they will ultimately find a home with consumers who feel they have no other choice. Humans might be better caretakers, but as they become more scarce, she says, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctechnology might be the next best thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Source https://www.fastcompany.com/90335808/will-robots-ever-be-better-caretakers-than-humans?partner=rss&amp;utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=rss+fastcompany&amp;utm_content=rss"

"Trusted 14:00 / 27.05.2019 Entrepreneur Can the Market Deliver the Consolidated FinTech Tool Small Businesses Need? FinTech May 27, 2019 5 min read Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. For most of us, payday is a relief. For the typical small business owner, it's a nail-biter. In her latest book, \u00e2\u0080\u009c Fintech, Small Business &amp; the American Dream ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Karen G. Mills, senior fellow at Harvard Business School, shares one entrepreneur's payday struggles. In chapter eight, Mills profiles a brewery owner who isn't sure whether she can afford to pay both her team and her vendors. Until she strings together data from dozens of apps and accounts, she doesn't know whether her business will be in the black or red that month. If you think Mills might have cherry-picked her example, consider that 63 percent\u00a0of small business owners surveyed by online lender Kabbage say they're regularly stressed about cash flow. The problem is so persistent that more than half of them had even gone multiple months without paying themselves. Entrepreneurship is financially risky, to be fair. But the brewery owner's struggles --\u00a0scattered services, insufficient data\u00a0and a lackluster user experience --\u00a0are ones Mills argues the market can solve. Three Providers, One Platform At present, three companies seem poised to fulfill Mills' vision for small business leaders. Although none yet offers a one-stop fintech tool, they've each got a good chance of becoming one. Intuit, provider of QuickBooks, TurboTax\u00a0and Mint, has the most tools but arguably the greatest challenges ahead of it. Not only do QuickBooks, TurboTax\u00a0and Mint each have their own use cases, but they command loyalty from distinctly different user bases. The reason is based in Intuit's business strategy. Since its founding in 1983, Intuit has made at least 28 acquisitions to broaden its service offerings. For online banking software, it bought Digital Insight in late 2006. The next year, it acquired Electronic Clearing House for check-processing power. That same month, it purchased Homestead Technologies for the company's e-commerce tools. In 2009, it added online payroll processing by acquiring PayCycle. Intuit's challenge is now consolidating all of those services and more within a single interface. Before it can truly be called the fintech platform to rule them all, Intuit needs to show it has the brand strength and UX skills to build a unified customer experience. Contemporary Competition The second company working toward Mills' dream for entrepreneurs has precisely the opposite issues of Intuit: Small business lending platform Kabbage may have mastered its niche, but it's missing many of the peripheral financial services that small business owners need. Kabbage's main challenge stems from the fact that it's barely a decade old. Because it grew up in the digital era, Kabbage gives small business owners the ability to link third-party business accounts , such as Amazon sales and UPS shipping data, to be approved for funding in minutes. But because it came of age so recently, Kabbage could struggle for traction in spaces like tax preparation, business budgeting and credit card processing -- areas that larger peers like Intuit are sure to fight for. What Kabbage lacks in scale, however, it may be able to make up for with its user experience. Because of its digital roots, Kabbage's user experience beats that of many traditional banks. When UserZoom compared it to Wells Fargo, the UX researcher found that Kabbage users were 16% more successful at identifying the true cost of a 12-month loan than those who do business with the major bank. Squaring Off Founded in 2009, Square is another digital native that may fulfill Mills' vision. Its advantages and challenges, however, are different than the ones Kabbage faces. Although Square has an app, the truth is that most small business owners see it as a point-of-sale solution. Mention Square, and most will think first about the company's iPad-like register terminals. Despite the fact that it also offers payroll services and small business loans, Square has struggled to brand itself as more than a credit card processor. To be sure, point-of-sale and card-processing tools are critical to many small businesses, particularly those in the retail space. But at present, Square's offerings are missing the data feeds that small business owners need. Its Square Capital page claims that application is easy, but it also notes that small business owners' eligibility \u00e2\u0080\u009ccomes down to [their] history with Square.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If Square hopes to be a one-stop platform, it needs a richer array of data feeds. Given the walled garden it's built, that's going to be difficult. As Mills makes clear, multiple financial firms have cobbled together pieces of her \u00e2\u0080\u009cone platform\u00e2\u0080\u009d ideal. Intuit has the breadth, Kabbage has the data\u00a0and Square has the hardware to stay top of mind. Which will win? That's a question that only small business owners can answer.

"Trusted 19:54 / 27.05.2019 Entrepreneur Many Leaders Routinely Make These 4 Mistakes -- Do You? Leadership Guest Writer Co-Founder and CEO of Webmetrix Group May 27, 2019 6 min read Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. From 2007 to 2012, Wells Fargo went through some serious growing pains. During that time, as detailed in a case study published by Duke Law, massive fraud was occurring . Bank employees would open unrequested accounts -- or convince customers to open accounts they didn't need -- in order to meet bonus goals. Evidently, some employees tried to alert management, but for whatever reason, news of the fraudulent activity never made it to the company's CEO. It's unclear why the message didn't travel all the way up the chain of command. Was there not a sound protocol in place? Were the leaders of Wells Fargo simply too busy to check in with lower management? Whatever the case, the scandal blew up, and Wells Fargo's CEO was partially blamed. As a leader , don't have complete control. That being said, there are certain things you can do, and mistakes you can avoid, to position yourself and your company for success. 1. Taking on too much As stated in a blog post written by Mark Moses, founding partner of CEO Coaching International, too many CEOs take on more than they can handle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSetting restrictions on what you will and won't do might sound indulgent or lazy\u00e2\u0080\u00a6trust me, it's not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Moses. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou're just stuck in a start-up mentality. If you don't stop thinking like someone running a business out of his or her garage and start thinking like a world-class CEO, your company will never be world class.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If you've been handling payroll, cleaning your office, updating your website and more, the advice above sounds pretty unrealistic. Luckily, this is where delegating comes into the picture. CEOs need to sit down and write out every task they carry out. If the task requires CEO-level attention , it can stay on the to-do list. Items that don't align with a CEO's core tasks (buying handsoap for the bathroom)\u00a0should be reassigned or given up altogether. 2. Forgetting to listen According to a study conducted by the Miles Group and Stanford Graduate School, CEOs typically rate low in people management --\u00a0especially when it comes to skills like listening. Although this issue is difficult to overcome, you can improve immensely by using what the Oxford Library of Psychology terms \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe science of compassion\u00e2\u0080\u009d in your workplace. David Desteno, a professor of psychology at Northeastern University, said in a recent article for Harvard Business Review , \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople made to feel pride and compassion are willing to persevere more than 30 percent longer on challenging tasks compared to those feeling other positive emotions, such as happiness, precisely because pride and compassion induce them to place greater value on future rewards.\ To put this managerial style into action, you have to start listening to your employees. Learn by speaking with them and their managers what they like and dislike about their jobs. Then, see how you can minimize their suffering and maximize the rewards they experience from working for your company. You also have to walk the walk in order for your team members to feel that you're leading with compassion . In short, focus on building trust and letting employees know that you stand behind them and are grateful to have them on your team. 3. Giving up too early Barnes &amp; Noble knew it was in for a fight as Amazon rose to power. At first, the bookseller came out strong, adding coffee shops to their bookstores to incentivize customer visits. And they went as far as creating an e-reader of their own to compete with the Amazon Kindle. Despite these big changes, Amazon continued to\u00a0thrive and at that point,\u00a0Barnes &amp; Noble pretty much gave up. The bookstore could have done more, but leadership either didn't have the stamina\u00a0or the ideas to try new tactics. Now, Amazon book sales continue to dominate the market. 4. Failing to set boundaries There's a lot of buzz surrounding flexible organizational structures these days. As the business landscape changes, many of the facets of the fixed organization fall -- hierarchy, function, etc. Although organization structures are changing, boundaries need to stay in place. As a CEO, you need to implement rules that will help your diverse team function on a high level, both with you and with one another. In an interview with Forbes' Dan Schawbel, Dr. Henry Cloud, a clinical psychologist who' made a career of advising CEOs, claims that leaders need to set several types of boundaries. He first suggests creating guidelines that allow your employees to focus on what is crucial. Another boundary Dr. Cloud advises is avoiding negative emotions. Business owners can create rules that foster a supportive emotional environment that's likely to promote performance and happiness. One instance of a boundary that must be set regards effective communication . The \u00e2\u0080\u009che said, she said\u00e2\u0080\u009d style of conversation is harmful and can damage the strength of your employee relationships. Instead, set a clear boundary that whatever you discuss with employees is in confidence. If the employee feels unwilling to talk with you one-on-one, ask him or her if they'd like the third party to come into the room. This way, everyone will have their side represented and heard without word-of-mouth confusion and second-hand information. There's always room for growth as a leader. Although Wells Fargo has a long way to go to regain customer trust, the company is starting out on the right foot. Over the last few years, the bank's been addressing improper sales practices and making changes to their organization. Along the way, Wells Fargo employees continue to work tirelessly to rebuild customer trust. Being a CEO is difficult, and mistakes are bound to happen. Luckily, with the right knowledge, you'll be able to identify and avoid common managerial mistakes before they inflict damage to your reputation and bottom line.

Through analysing year-on-year trends within the rankings, and comparing the top cases with all other case studies published on WARC in the same year, we can establish what differentiates a highly awarded Effective 100 campaign from a more \u00e2\u0080\u0098typical\u00e2\u0080\u0099 example of an effective marketing campaign.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The three key trends from this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s WARC Effective 100 are: 1. Effectiveness in a low-attention economy There is more competition for attention than ever before. Capturing the attention of consumers, which has become a measure of campaign effectiveness, now requires innovation in both creativity and media placement. There are four key responses highlighted from analysing the Effective 100 to achieve this: 1. Creativity, and in particular the use of emotional appeals. 59% of the campaigns in the ranking used this approach. 2. The growing use of influencers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 more than 20% of case studies in the Effective 100 contained specific influencer elements. 3. The use of PR-driven stunts as a means to catch the attention of both consumers and the media is a recurring theme \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as seen in Fearless Girl, The Mud Soldier for Visit Flanders and Google Home of the Whopper. 4. A greater focus on unconventional media placement, such as reaching people when they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect it, as seen in India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Newest Status Symbol for Harpic. Says Faris Yakob, founder of strategy and innovation consultancy, Genius Steals: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s WARC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Effective 100 suggests that the most effective ads, all over the world, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look like ads. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trust ads, which live trapped in media, a way for brands to overcome this is by making real things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Saregama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Carvaan and Savlon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Soap Sticks are some of the examples Yakob cites. 2. Distinctive assets and the importance of being recognised Distinctive brand assets are emerging as a key weapon of effective campaigns. The importance of being recognisable is evident in this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Effective 100, with the development of brand equity a central objective and measure of many of the campaigns. Success stories in the Effective 100 include \u00e2\u0080\u0098Kevin the Carrot: How Aldi UK won Christmas with the help of a humble carrot\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (ranked #25), the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Made for More\u00e2\u0080\u0099 campaign for Guinness (ranked #31), and \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Door Blouse\u00e2\u0080\u0099 campaign in India for Narayana Health (ranked #20). Says Heather Andrew, UK CEO, Neuro-Insight: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNowadays many brands are developing and codifying a wider set of distinctive assets that can be transferred across platforms as a way of delivering instant recognition. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn terms of brain response this makes complete sense. In brand communication, memory response is crucial \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if something doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get into memory it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t possibly affect our future behaviour \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and one of the crucial characteristics of memory is that it works by association.\u00e2\u0080\u009d 3. Balancing brand building and performance Brand-building and performance marketing are often distinct activities, but pressure is growing to integrate the two, with teams working together for mutual benefit. Examples of campaigns in the Effective 100 that have successfully combined measuring \u00e2\u0080\u0098brand\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in a more data-driven way, and enhancing performance through cohesive narratives include \u00e2\u0080\u0098Beauty And Brains for Aldi (ranked #8) and IKEA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Wonderful Everyday'(#43). Says Dan Hagen, global chief strategy officer, iProspect: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the mad rush of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world, we rarely spend enough time and effort really diagnosing the problem we have before we jump to solutions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hagen adds, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to think of it like a three-legged race rather than a relay. It is about different talents working in tandem and the collision of those specialism will drive a different level of performance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A summary of WARC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Lessons from the global effectiveness rankings can be downloaded here. The full report is available to WARC subscribers and includes in-depth study of the three themes with commentary from industry experts, a spotlight on Carvaan for Saregama, the top ranked campaign, data analysis behind the winning campaigns, and expert commentary across the results of the Effective 100. The WARC Effective 100, formerly the WARC 100, is an annual ranking of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top campaigns and companies for effectiveness, based on the results of effectiveness competitions. It forms part of WARC Rankings, successor to the Gunn Report, which track the winners\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lists from all the most important advertising award contests, globally."

Sales therefore increased by approx. 30% from year to year to approximately EUR 78 million and EBIT by 6% to about EUR 8 million. The exact results will be published on May 13th. I am more than happy with this result. It is important to note that looking at profits should not be the first priority in the current business world, as much of the profit is meaningfully reinvested in future growth. Hypoport is a high-scale platform company that, without reinvesting in future growth and technology leadership, has realistic opportunities to achieve EBIT margins of up to 50% in the future. Although the company looks visually expensive, it is a clear long-term purchase at the current level. Europe's market penetration is progressing faster and faster, especially savings banks and cooperative banks are currently collaborating at a huge pace with Europace. The insurance platform is well on course to penetrate the market and represent another unicorn for Hypoport in the future. If you want to know more about the Hypoport story, please read my detailed analyzes from last year. http://unique-investors.de/unternehmensanalyse-hypoport-ag/ (30.04 12:22) Nemetschek 7.29% GrowthPlus (042013): Today, specialists specialize in construction specialists our depot.

Nemetschek with a new annual high and RIB Software has been in a wonderful upswing since December. The bill in our depot \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \""All in one \u00e2\u0080\u00a6. Turbo\"" is currently almost 25% on the front.

So today I have bought 180 pieces to convert more money into shares and of course continue to benefit from the potential. (30.04, 11:28) Biofronter 4.22% MerlinMart (OLEUR): As planned, the B8F position will be further expanded. The latest confirmation of BE in Q4 2019 and the latest developments regarding Ameluz suggests that the stock will continue to gain momentum. Also interesting is the current listing on the takeover bid from Maruho (6.60 euros). This can be speculated on an early increase in the supply of Maruho, at least to achieve the blocking minority 25%. All in all, I expect to see the share in the double-digit range at the end of the year!

"Rare partners with Sweetshop to give minority talent unprecedented access to D&amp;AD Festival in London and Semi Permanent in Sydney this May Rare partners with Sweetshop to give minority talent unprecedented access to D&amp;AD Festival in London and Semi Permanent in Sydney this May When it comes to the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top creative conferences and festivals, the V-V-VIP access is usually reserved for the people who need it the least. The international judges, the local agency leaders, the heavy-hitting CMOs. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the people at the top of their game. And so, being in among the action has little impact on their careers. But when you offer that kind of access to promising up-and-comers, says Tara McKenty, Rare co-founder and Google creative lead, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like rocket fuel to fire. Says McKenty: \u00e2\u0080\u009cEarly on in my career, I was sent to Cannes by a group of amazing sponsors that saw promise in me \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and it changed everything. The industry heavyweights that I met became my mentors. The work that I saw on display challenged me to produce the kind of work that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s won for me ever since. And the insight that I got into our industry has shaped the path I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken to where I am today.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an experience shared by many \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one powerful enough to usher a new generation of diverse talent into leadership positions across the creative industries. Which is something Wilf Sweetland, global CEO and partner at Sweetshop, is just as passionate about. Says Sweetland: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe work that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen coming from diverse talent over the years has been exciting to me. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fresh, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s raw, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rich in cultural vibrancy. The more we support that kind of talent to flourish, the bolder the work will be. And Rare Access is exactly the kind of support that I think will be the catalyst to making this happen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rare Access launches this May, at both D&amp;AD in London and Semi Permanent in Sydney. A partnership between Rare and Sweetshop that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s set to roll out at all major festivals throughout the year \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it gives diverse talent the kind of access they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d receive if they were judging the awards or headlining the festival. Says Stefanie DiGianvincenzo, Rare co-founder and strategic director: \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom shadowing the juries, to private dinners with festival headliners, Rare Access really is a money-can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t-buy experience. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only possible because our festival partners are as passionate about this as we are, and so they open up places at their most exclusive engagements and experiences.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With Semi Permanent taking place in just two weeks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 time, the team at Sweetshop are now looking for Australia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most promising underrepresented talent to fill the Rare Access places. There are two Rare Access passes available, offering the chance to join the speakers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 welcome reception, stay alongside the speakers at the QT Hotel, attend a private dinner with three international headliners, take part in the Rare Masterclass, and receive a premium pass to the Semi Permanent festival. Flights are also included \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so interstate applications are welcomed. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to apply, simply get in touch via kneill@thesweetshop.tv and answer two questions: 1. What makes you Rare? 2. What could Rare Access do for your career?

"VMLY&amp;R unveils YouTube Stories \u00e2\u0080\u0093 profiling three extraordinary Aussies leaving lasting change VMLY&amp;R Sydney has launched a new campaign for YouTube that showcases the stories of three incredible Aussies \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Charles Lomu, Macinley Butson and Eddie Woo \u00e2\u0080\u0093 who have had a profound impact on their communities, by using YouTube as an educational platform to learn and teach. Says Mark Wheeler, head of YouTube marketing for Australia and New Zealand: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMore and more Aussies are coming to YouTube to learn with educational videos generating hundreds of millions of views. I am always inspired by hearing people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal stories about what they have learned on YouTube and then gone on to achieve. In the words of Eddie Woo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYouTube is democratising education\u00e2\u0080\u009d. We wanted to tell some of these stories to share with Aussies that information is simply a \u00e2\u0080\u0098how to\u00e2\u0080\u0099 search away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To tell the remarkable stories of Charles, Macinley and Eddie, YouTube turned to VMLY&amp;R and Versus Media.

Says Aden Hepburn, joint-CEO, VMLY&amp;R: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSix-second content is the new normal and there is certainly a war for attention, however audiences still crave long-form content. Winning your audience\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u0099 attention from the get-go and maintaining it throughout, with a heart-beat story arc, is the key to making engaging content in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s content saturated marketplace.

Muna Al-Fuzai: Huawei or Google [Kuwait Times]
"Motorola One vs Motorola One Vision, What Has Changed? Android One is not really a version of Android but a Google application, enabling updates without intervention from the smartphone manufacturer, giving more flexibility in the updates and guaranteeing that they are made during a period of 2 years. The goal is to gain experience of what many people call \Pure Android\"" to devices other than Pixels Pixels ] and Nexus. There are other manufacturers besides Motorola who bring with Android One in their smartphones. I find it strange that since Android Xiaomi HTC and some other devices. One arose, very few smartphones got the version of Android. So far, there are only 15 smartphones. And then Motorola One came last year, and on May 15, Motorola One Vision hit the Brazilian market, but after all, if both smartphones have the same system. Motorola One and One Vision \u00e2\u0080\u009c/&gt; Motorola One and One Vision Here are some key points that determine that while Motorola Motorola One remains an option in its price range, the recently launched Motorola One Vision, draws attention to design and specifications and even price! Motorola One Vision has a larger battery, 3.500mAh against 3.000mAh by Motorola One. In addition to the screen size and resolution is different we have a new screen FullHD + on 6.3 inch with 21: 9 format on the Motorola One Vision on a screen HD + 5.9-inch 19: 9 format on the Motorola One. Today, points like cameras in smartphones are virtually a decision factor. ] Motorola One Vision, gives much better cameras than last year's version, Motorola One train 8-megapixel front camera Motorola One Vision ] gives camera to self-megapixels with 25 megapixels the difference is very large. en gives a set of rear cameras, Motorola One camera with 13 megapixels and another with 2 megapixels gives Motorola One Vision ] 48 megapixel camera and a 5 megapixel camera. It is worth mentioning here that the main camera for One Vision still delivers optical image stabilization technology of this year's smartphone. \u00e2\u0080\u009c/&gt; There is a big difference in the processing here The changes do not end there, the processors are also different and for the first time ] Motorola takes a processor from Samsung instead of a Qualcomm. The Motorola One Vision delivers Exynos 7 9609 128GB of internal memory, against a Snapdragon 625 and 64GB of internal memory in the Motorola One. The only specification retained was the quantity of RAM in both models, both with 4 GB of RAM. Both smartphones allow the expansion of storage via microSD card, for the Motorola One Vision up to 512 GB and for the Motorola One, up to 256 GB. You have to wonder who compares a smartphone to another after more than a year? The point here is not to make improvements, it is obvious that everything on the smartphone gets better (sometimes it does not happen). But when you compare your prices it is worth looking at Motorola One, if you still don't have it in their piggy bank, enough coins to buy a newly released model, like the Motorola One Vision.

"YouTube voted as Australia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading youth brand YouTube voted as Australia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading youth brand This year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Youth Marketing Australia conference saw YouTube announced as the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading youth brand, with so many young Australians on the video platform, we can see why this brand was dubbed the most loved by Australia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s youth. Other winners included the likes of Woolworths, Qantas, CBA, Google, McDonald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, Sprite and Netflix to name a few. Following the hugely successful YMA conference held in Melbourne on Friday and Saturday (24th and 25th May 2019), Growth Tank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partnership with Youth Insight presented an exclusive study, uncovering a unique piece of research, the Top 100 Youth Brands Report. Surveying over 2,000 Australians aged 14- 24; this provided an honest look at their most loved brands. The study looked at which brands Australia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s young people love the most and which brands really impact their lives. The research included brands across several different categories from retail to social media. The winners of each category are: \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Retail and Online Retail: Woolworths \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Health &amp; Beauty: Dove \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Travel: Qantas \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Fast Food &amp; Restaurant: McDonald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Non- Alcoholic Drinks: Sprite \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Sports: Nike \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Telecommunications: Optus \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Finance: Commonwealth Bank \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Digital &amp; Technology: Google \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Social Media &amp; App: YouTube \u00e2\u0080\u0093 General Youth: Netflix \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Overall best brand: YouTube Says David Willey, founder, Growth Tank: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo win with young consumers in 2019, constant innovation, exciting collaborations and staying on top of the trends are paramount. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the big name brands that constantly offer something new that keeps them in favour with GenZ, with the biggest innovators and disruptors rising to the top of our survey. Innovation is important to Gen Z and Millennials, who are always on the lookout for something new.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Says Cristiano Lima, head of research at Youth Insight: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe sought to discover the brands that are most discussed by young people; that are loved or hated; that influence young people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lives and are actively marketed to young people. We ensure that we cover a wide range of brands, from the large multinationals to the cult favourites, and everything in between.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A curated list of 1,000 brands was then put to the membership community of Student Edge\u00e2\u0080\u0094which includes more than 1.1 million young people\u00e2\u0080\u0094resulting in a final ranked Top 100. Says Simon Miraudo, editor and head of communications and membership at Student Edge: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you hear the way our respondents talk about some of their favourite brands, you come to realise that the exchanges they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re having aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t merely transactional; these brands have leapfrogged their rivals by embedding themselves in the very experience of being a young person. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo brand does it better than YouTube, which takes pole position in our survey. YouTube gives users a platform to communicate as well as consume, with the possibility of a celebrity always on the horizon. The allure of becoming a \u00e2\u0080\u0098YouTuber\u00e2\u0080\u0099, or engaging with them, allows Gen Z to indulge both their introspective and outspoken sides. On YouTube, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the stars, but also, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where they feel most heard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For more information, visit the website here."

"Trusted 18:05 / 27.05.2019 SUN Asda has a garden furniture sale that includes sofa sets, swings and BBQs Items included in the sale include corner sofas, table and chair sets, and even a swing. Of course, just because something's on sale doesn't necessarily make it a good deal. We found a 10ft trampoline, for example, that was cheaper elsewhere. So compare prices before you buy using Google Shopping or a similar online price tool. Also make sure you check delivery fees - standard delivery is from \u00c2\u00a32.75 although you can click and collect for free from Asda stores. It's unclear if the sale is in store too, so you may want to pop down to your local store to check. Use Asda's store locator tool to find your nearest. We've rounded-up some of the best buys below. Orlando Garden Chaise and Footstool This corner sofa and footstool comes in black rattan with detachable charcoal-coloured cushions. The sofa measures in at 213cm x 146cm x 63cm, while the stool is 64.5cm x 64.5cm x 30cm - but be aware that you will have to assemble it yourself. This isn't the cheapest corner sofa set out there as Aldi's comes in \u00c2\u00a350 less at \u00c2\u00a3199.99 . But it is cheaper than Argos , which is selling a similar one for \u00c2\u00a3370. Turbary Rattan Four Piece Garden Sofa Set This garden furniture set includes one coffee table, one sofa and two chairs, which all come in rattan with steel frames. The table measures 42cm x 75cm x 48cm, while the sofa comes in at 78.5cm x 107.5cm x 62cm, and the chairs are each 78.5cm x 60.5cm x 62cm. Again, you'll need to assemble them yourself. This is the cheapest we could find this set for - it's even selling for \u00c2\u00a3229.89 on eBay . Similar sets cost \u00c2\u00a3127.99 at Wayfair . Sportspower Saucer Swing Keep little ones entertained for hours with this saucer swing for children aged three to eight. The swing can take the weight of kids up to 45kg and measures in at 180cm x 202cm x 172cm. This is a good deal as a similar size swing that takes the same weight costs \u00c2\u00a380 at Argos and \u00c2\u00a371.99 at Very . Expert Grill 75cm Barrel Grill with Lid This charcoal burning half-drum shape BBQ is ideal for cooking for up to 20 people and it includes a warming rack to keep your burgers toasty. Just make sure it'll fit in your garden before you snap it up - it measures in a 100cm x 69cm x 90cm. This is the cheapest BBQ of this size we could find online, although it's closely followed by Argos' charcoal oil drum BBQ with warming rack that costs \u00c2\u00a340. CHICKEN LIES 'Shamima Begum' reviews Asda chicken saying she 'loves it more than freedom' SUPERMARKET SAVVY What are the opening hours for Asda on bank holiday Monday? OUT OF SUPPLIES?

"The fantastic way you can see Hull like you've never seen it before The Maritime Museum, Wilberforce House, Ferens Art Gallery, Trinity House and the Holy Trinity Church are but a few pieces of architecture that hark back to times gone by. But what if you could see what Hull used to look like before it was battered by the Blitz in the Second World War ? It is almost 75 years since the war ended, with 95 per cent of Hull's houses being hit and tragically more than 1,200 people being killed , destroying the way the city used to look. Now though, thanks to the use of technology, the history of Hull has been brought to life on a special tour. Through the use of digital technology, Mike Covell, who runs Amazing Hull Tours, is able to show the public images of old Hull while standing in the same spot - meaning you can see Hull in a way few have seen before. The historian specialises in over 49 tours, including WW2 Hull Blitz tours and ghost walks. His true crime tours are a huge hit, discussing grisly topics like The Silver Hatchet Gang, The Caughey Street Murder and the infamous Beverley Road \Bum stabber\"" . He even has a \""Jack the Ripper\"" tour, which explores 14 suspects with links to Hull, plus a number of Ripper scares, and a Ripper letter sent to the Hull press in October 1888. But if crime isn't your thing, there are other tours as well - from lost pubs to lost cinema, Victorian architecture, Hull Heroes, Ballad tours, Jewish tours and a Black History tour. The tours are for everyone including schools, colleges and the University of Hull in which Mike showcases the history, culture and art of Hull to all the international students who come to the city. He gave Hull Live reporter Anna Riley a bespoke tour of the city, showing the centre in a way that it has never been seen before. Hammonds We started in the spot where House of Fraser is now at Paragon Station in Hull city centre and where Hammonds used to stand before it was bombed in 1941. Mike held up his iPad with an image of how the department store used to look for comparison. The deadly German air raids in May 1941 gutted the building but within weeks, 47 departments had reopened in temporary locations and carried on with the business for the rest of the war. \""Many staff from Hammonds still came to work the next day and carried on their duties as normal after bombing had destroyed the department store, which really shows true grit,\"" said Mike. \""When peace came, plans for a new store were drawn up and the new building eventually opened on the same site in May 1952. \""In Hull, 1,200 civilians died during the bombings and the People's Memorial now next to House of Fraser commemorates this.\"" Maritime Museum The magnificent Victorian building which is home to the Maritime Museum was one of the few buildings in Victoria Square that remained unscathed during the bombings in Hull. Opening as Hull's Dock Offices in 1871, the building stood the test of time and was transformed into a museum in the mid-1970s. While housing some incredible and fascinating artefacts, the city centre museum has remained much the same for the past 40 years. But this could soon change as Hull City Council hope to win a Heritage Lottery Fund bid for millions of pounds as part of Hull: Yorkshire Maritime City project . If successful, it will turn the museum into a bigger and brighter attraction, with better access to showcase Hull's rich maritime past. Mike provided a 360 degree view of pictures showing how the area used to look around the Maritime Museum. \""Lots of buildings were bombed near to the Maritime Museum during the war,\"" he told me. \""Near where Barclays stands now used to be rows of houses where a large population lived. \""Many of these homes were decimated during the Blitz and the whole area had to be rebuilt from scratch. \""Looking at the buildings not just here, but all around the city centre, you can tell where they have been rebuilt as often they are modern in contrast to the older pre-war buildings, or they have modern additions to the tops of older buildings which looks out of place\"". Beverley Gate Beverley Gate near to Whitefriargate is another spot in Hull that is steeped in history. It is the spot where King Charles was famously refused entry to Hull by Sir John Hotham in 1642 - an act of defiance widely acknowledged as the spark that ignited the English Civil War. Remains of the walls, which included a number of gated entrances, were originally uncovered during an archaeological excavation in the late 1980s. The important site was then given a makeover in July 2017 as part of the public realm programme in the city centre for UK City of Culture . An actual stone arch used to be in place at the entrance to Whitefriargate and this was later replaced by wood to show how it used to look. While standing next to the excavated spot, Mike showed an image of the wooden structure, looking every bit medieval, with a horse and cart coming through the entrance to the thoroughfare. The wooden structure collapsed in time and had to be dismantled but it certainly shows an impressive and grand entrance way to Whitefriargate reminiscent of similar structures in cities like York. Whitefriargate Whitefriargate is filled with buildings that echo past times and many shops now down there have a story to tell. \""Whitefriargate used to be the bustling hub of Hull for shopping,\"" said Mike, showing a black and white picture of Woolworths, bustling with activity while we were stood outside the now closed Marks &amp; Spencer. \""I like to take people down here on a night when it's less busy as in the evening it is easier to look up more and have time to appreciate the buildings and view just how detailed they are, like the chimneys and windows that are so detailed. \""Most buildings have a story attached to them down here -\u00a0 Louis Carroll's grandfather had links to the Boots that used to be here, which is now the Works building. \""There used to be an old workhouse near HMV and Frederick Bailey, a bigamist, defrauded the bank that used to operate here. \""It is amazing what you can find when you delve a bit deeper - Whitefriargate for example gets its name as bones were uncovered here of old friars. Mike even spotted a picture of himself in Whitefriargate, which he was placed in to honour his work during the Hull City of Culture 2017. \""I've always lived history and had a passion for local history that I got from dad,\"" he said, pointing it out. Hull Minster Hull Minster has 700 years of history and is as old as Hull itself.\u00a0Since the 1300s, the church has been a constant presence in the city centre and survived both Zeppelin raids and Nazi bombings during the First and Second World Wars. The church was Holy Trinity Church until it was given minster status in May 2017 and the Grade I listed building is the largest parish church in England by floor area. The place has strong connections to great people like Andrew Marvell and William Wilberforce, stained glass windows of national significance. The minster used to be surrounded in fencing but now stands proud and open to all in the heart of the city centre. Market Place Market Place, where the King Billy statue resides near the disused Art Nouveau gents toilets, has links to gin. The impressive gilded statue of King William III was erected in 1734 in honour of William of Orange \u00e2\u0080\u0093 who has the distinction of introducing England to gin, which he brought from his native Holland. And he even has his own pub named after him in Hull, with the toilets nearby holding an amusing story, with Mike revealing that goldfish used to swim about in the gents Hull's amazing history Throughout the tour, Mike was clearly proud of Hull and it's history and explained why he thought it was such a great city. \""We have an amazing city and need to showcase it,\"" he said. \""The wonderful architecture dating back to the 1700s and before that we still have in Hull is a real jewel in history's crown. \""The rich history that we have here from banishing Charles 1, to the wars and William Wilberforce, as well as the current history we have with how Hull is changing all the time is impressive. \""All the quirks here are great too, like our cream telephone boxes, intricate windows, street furniture, memorials and plaques for people to discover. \""I also think the ghost stories of the city are amazing like the reported hauntings in the Old White Heart and Ye Old Black Boy, its facinating.\"" Amazing Hull Tours has been going since 2013, with new tours costing between \u00c2\u00a34 and \u00c2\u00a35 being added every year.

"A new shop for 'geeks and nerds' will open in Whitefriargate Bad Wolf Gaming Ltd, the brainchild of friends Ash Tyson and James Wilson, will open at the top of Whitefriargate in the early summer. The ambitious pair, who met while working at a now closed shop in the street, will turn their gaming hobbies into retail careers, offering a community space for residents and visitors to enjoy with some exciting plans in the pipeline. The ground floor will offer a vibrant retail outlet, filled with latest games, TV, film and pop culture accessories and will include brands such as Pokemon and the entertainment genre Anime. Also on the ground floor, a separate section will be a dedicated space for locals looking to break into the retail market. Mr Tyson said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhether they are selling hand-made jewellery, or they are artists, we hope they will come along and use the space to display what they are creating and selling. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe want to offer this space to others to help them promote their work and give them a stepping-stone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Tourist Information Centre will also have a physical presence within the store three days a week in a bid to promote the whole area. Further down the line, the pair are looking to develop the upstairs second floor into a retro cinema with the first floor converted into a games space where customers can play anything from Dungeons and Dragons to Monopoly. This will also include a Steampunk-themed tuck-shop and bar. With the support of Scotts Property and chartered surveyor Nick Coultish, the pair have managed to turn their dream a reality. Mr Coultish is delighted to see an independent business take shape in a location that has been hit hard by the high street downturn. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not see the decline of high streets continuing, as some people may have predicted,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cInstead they will evolve and change and what Ash and James are doing is proof of that. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAsh and James have identified an opportunity and understand that retail needs to offer more than ever, providing the consumer with a positive leisure experience in addition to traditional retailing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAsh and James's vision does just that, combining traditional retail with incubating a community that will support the independent retailer for years to come. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope this is one of many positive stories on Whitefriargate and anticipate that it will continue to revitalise and reinvent itself over years to come. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis opening sends out a really positive message and we wish them well. We also hope others follow, taking advantage of the opportunities that exist along the street.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bad Wolf Gaming is expected to open in June and can be found at 37-38 Whitefriargate.

"East Yorkshire is the best place to drive in the UK - but not everyone agrees According to research by loan company Moneybarn, the county's roads are the least frustrating to drive on with a number of factors including congestion , average speeds and the number of speed cameras and potholes taken into consideration. Out of 47 counties, East Yorkshire's frustration score was the lowest at 0.31 with Greater London, Greater Manchester and the West Midlands deemed to be the most stressful places to drive in the country. As part of the research there were 22 reported speed cameras and 504 reported potholes in the county with the average delays on A roads coming in at just 17.7 seconds per vehicle per mile. Although the encouraging research suggests East Yorkshire is a stress-free place to drive, not everyone in Hull agrees with one driver condemning the data as \u00e2\u0080\u009cb******s\u00e2\u0080\u009d. In the Hull Traffic &amp; Travel Facebook group, one woman said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cKidding aren't ya! Way too many idiots on these roads stop you having a nice stress free drive! \u00e2\u0080\u009cMe and my family were nearly in a crash on the way home down Hedon Road coz some d*** h*** thought he'd just cut into my lane whilst I was right at the side of him! \u00e2\u0080\u009cLooked like he was paying more attention to his phone than the roads!!!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Another said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre they taking the Mick? Probably written by someone who hasn't experienced the pothole hell of Hull and accident prone A63 .\u00e2\u0080\u009d Drivers criticised the state of the roads during rush hour, with one man saying it is best to \u00e2\u0080\u009cavoid Victoria Dock at 8am\u00e2\u0080\u009d and others condemning the county's \u00e2\u0080\u009ccrap roads\u00e2\u0080\u009d which one said were \u00e2\u0080\u009cfull of potholes\u00e2\u0080\u009d. However, others agreed with the research and said East Yorkshire was a pleasant place to drive. One man said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost of the East Riding is pretty nice, to be fair. Outside Willerby, Hessle , Beverley and Cottingham it's an expanse of more than adequate, flat, safe roads with relatively few potholes and little traffic.\u00e2\u0080\u009d poll loading Do you think Hull and East Yorkshire is the best place to drive in the UK 0+ VOTES SO FAR Another man added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHull is so easy to drive around compared to other cities. Go to London for the day and you will miss East Yorkshire so much.\u00e2\u0080\u009d We've created a Facebook group for people who live in and travel through Hull and East Yorkshire to stay up to date with what's happening on the roads and the trains. We will keep you informed about the latest news that could affect your journey to work or school, as well as at the weekend. We'll also let you know in advance if there are any roadworks, railworks or closures you should know about, or if there are any problems on the Humber Bridge. Join the group here .

Both the US and Google have granted Huawei a stay of execution over Android after realizing an immediate ban would have a severe impact on existing owners of Huawei devices, especially smartphones, after buying them in good faith. The reprieve was contemptuously brushed aside by Huawei which has decided to come out fighting, having failed with its previous conciliatory efforts in which it had offered to submit software and hardware to independent verification before deployment.

Monsees will join WPP AUNZ from the BMW Group, where he was most recently corporate vice president leading global digital strategy, corporate planning and product strategy. During his time at BMW, Monsees has been instrumental in the business and cultural transformation of the global BMW Group from a traditional Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) into a customer- focused and data-driven mobility tech company. Prior to BMW, Monsees held a range of senior executive positions in digital marketing and branding, including: global CEO, digital marketing at Arvato AG (part of the Bertelsmann Group); branding director for automotive, consumer goods, food retail and health care at Google Germany; and various other marketing and branding roles at Mondelez and Schwarzkopf &amp; Henkel. Says Rob Mactier, chairman, WPP AUNZ: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe board conducted an extensive global search to identify the best leader for the company. This appointment underlines our new positioning as a leader not only in creative advertising, branding, communications and media but in technology, data and business transformation.

We have spent time in Australia over the years and what strikes me is the openness of the people, the frankness in the conversation and the ambition in business.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Monsees will take over from John Steedman, who stepped in as interim CEO in October 2018. Steedman will continue to lead WPP AUNZ with the executive leadership team until Mr Monsees takes up his position.

"Google Files rewards: How to earn Rs 1,000 by sharing files offline Google Assistant now introduces visual snapshot feature Google's file managing app 'Files' has crossed 100 million downloads in January, but it seems the company is not satisfied with numbers. To add more users, the search giant is offering up to Rs 1,000 reward for using its offline file transfer app and redeem as Google Pay credit. Google launched Files in 2017, which helps users to remove junk and clean up their device with a single tap. It also features file sharing ability without going online. Now, it is interesting that the app pays users for sending and receiving files using the app. For every successful transfer, users can earn Rs 100 as a prize. The offer is limited to ten successful transfers, which add up to Rs 1,000. However, you can change your account by just unlinking it and can link a new account to earn more rewards. How to get a reward by using Google Files? First, you will have to install Google Files app or if you are an existing user, then switch to the share tab, which is located at bottom right corner. In the Share tab, you will see \Earn Reward\"" message. If you can't find that message, then wait for a while as it will pop up after some time, which was the case with us. After clicking on Start, you will have to link your Google account. Now, you are ready to win rewards. Next step to follow is Connect your Google Files app to your friend's app and share files. Notably, you both have signed up for a reward. As the file transfer finishes, you will receive a notification, which greets you and tells you that you have won a reward. Now you will have to claim this reward with Google Pay using a scratch card in your Google Pay reward section. In no time, your reward will be in your bank account. It's as simple as that.

"Trusted 12:38 / 27.05.2019 SUN Earth's water came from ALIEN molecules carried on comets billions of years ago Earth is thought to have formed as a dry planet, which then received water from a mysterious collision with other celestial objects. Just last week, planetologists at the University of M\u00c3\u00bcnster in Germany proposed that water actually arrived on Earth at exactly the same time that the Moon was created with the Theia impact over 4billion years ago. Before this Theia water hypothesis, a lot of scientists thought that water was brought to Earth by watery meteorites from the outer solar system. Now, an international team of researchers think they have strong evidence for this meteorite theory. They claim to have found one family of comets, called hyperactive comets, that contain water similar to the water we have on Earth and think that it must have been these comets that brought H2O to our planet. The researchers traced the source of terrestrial water by looking at the ratio of isotopes in the liquid. As a comet approaches the Sun, its ice instantly turns into water vapour and this vapour can be analysed remotely with airborne observatories. A comet called 46P/Wirtanen approached the Earth in December 2018 and was analysed using the SOFIA airborne observatory that was placed on a Boeing aircraft. It was found to have similar isotopic ratios to terrestrial water, leading the researcher to believe that hyperactive comets just like 46P/Wirtanen were responsible for bringing water to Earth. What is the Theia impact? Everything you need to know about the collision that could have changed the world... Comet 46P Wirtanen will orbit close enough to planet Earth it can be seen with the naked eye on the 16 Dec 2018 HORROR-SCOPE You've been reading the wrong horoscope for years because the stars have moved MEGAMIND 'Google' brain implants could end school as anyone can learn anything instantly HOT STUFF Scientists create sound so loud it bursts your heart and lungs TIDAL TERROR Sea level 'doomsday' simulator reveals whether YOUR home would be wiped out HISTORY REBORN Stunning video reveals how 7 Ancient Wonders of the World would look today CODE broken World's most mysterious text the Voynich manuscript is decoded after 600 YEARS We pay for your stories!

"Scumbag' legs it as dogs savage Cockapoo in front of horrified children A warning has been posted on Facebook to residents in Bilton after cockapoo Bertie was \savagely set upon\"" by \""three Staffie types\"" outside Bilton Community Primary School at around 3.20pm on May 26. Bertie was being taken to the nearby fields for a walk when another dog walker shouted over to Bertie's owner, saying \u00e2\u0080\u0098oh! S**t' as his dogs charged towards them. Shocked onlookers raced to help Bertie as he tried to defend himself while his frantic owner did everything she could to protect her beloved pet. Bertie was then rushed to the vets and has needed a minimum of \u00c2\u00a31,000 worth of treatment. The Facebook post on the Bilton Crimewatch and village community discussion group reads: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy wife was walking our cockerpoo Bertie on a lead past the front of the school approaching the entrance to the fields when she heard a male voice shout, \u00e2\u0080\u0098have you got a dog with you?' Watch: How do police deal with minor crimes? \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe replied \u00e2\u0080\u0098yes'. The man shouted, \u00e2\u0080\u0098oh s**t' and with that three Staffie-type dogs set about savaging Bertie. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it was not for the help of nearby residents and children who rushed to assist there is no doubt Bertie would not have survived. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs it is, he is in a really bad way and is currently being treated by the emergency vet. We are waiting to hear how bad things are, but we have been told it will be a minimum of \u00c2\u00a31,000 in vet charges. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy wife is distressed, covered in blood and did her best to protect Bertie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The owner of the three dogs is said to have then made a run for it towards the Asda snicket following the attack. He is described as being 5ft 10ins tall, with brown, average length hair and of a solid build. It is estimated he was in his thirties and was wearing navy trousers. Bertie's owners commended the bravery of those who helped. The post continues: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo those local residents and children who bravely did their best to help \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we are more than grateful for what you did to assist. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWithout you we are sure Bertie would now be dead. Words cannot express our appreciation fully. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo the scumbag \u00e2\u0080\u0093 when you shouted \u00e2\u0080\u0098oh shit', you obviously fully knew what your dogs would do and what they are capable of. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are a disgrace and I hope those b*****d dogs turn on you with a vengeance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The attack has been reported to Humberside Police .

"Plans for a new caf\u00c3\u00a9 bar in Hessle to open at old Surprises shop A new caf\u00c3\u00a9 bar could open in Hessle under new proposals. P&amp;B Catering has submitted a planning application to turn former balloon and cards shop Surprises premises in Prestongate into the new drinks outlet . Surprises has since moved to its new home round the corner in The Weir. Mayo Binnie, of P&amp;B Catering, has previously run the mobile coffee shop Rendezvous and helped establish the Two Gingers caf\u00c3\u00a9 in the Paragon Arcade, Hull. The caf\u00c3\u00a9 bar would have seating for around 30-40 people and open from 10am until 10pm daily. A key focus of the venue would be to use locally-sourced beers and coffees. In the application form P&amp;B Catering says: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe proposed use is a small speciality coffee shop with the addition of retail craft beer, natural wines and equipment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will be stocking local products from Atom Brewery in Hull. Crafty Little Brewery in Brough, Laurel Vines in Aike, the Blending Room coffee in Hull but also offering products from Bonanza Coffee in Berlin and Garage Brewing in Barcelona. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe do not believe any additional noise, odour or transport issues will arise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Watch: how the planning process works The applicant says there will be no major external works undertaken and only some refurbishment inside to bring it up to date and turn it into a caf\u00c3\u00a9 use. East Riding Council's planning committee is set to consider the application in July.

"The gruesome punishments handed out to criminals in Hull Any number of misdemeanours were a hanging offence and some crimes punished we would not even recognise or consider illegal now. Punishments were often swift, makeshift and brutal. Local historian Mike Covell takes a look at some of the crimes and punishments meted out in Hull from the Medieval to Victorian times . Coining This was the process of creating counterfeit money a few hundred years ago and those caught were often hanged. On March 27, 1575 Hull man Frederick Gottfried was discovered to have been coining. He was arrested, tried, and sent to York where he was hanged.\u00a0 Another Hull man also caught was Joseph Hall, who was hanged at York in 1768. Hanging a popular punishment Capital punishment has long since been outlawed in the UK and even when it was still an option only the most heinous crimes would result in such an extreme penalty. As well as coining, any number of crimes were punishable by hanging. Hull man Robert Skelton was hanged at York for forging a will. Henry Cave and William Cropper, also of Hull, were hanged at York for the act of rebellion and Nathanial Picket was hanged at York for scuttling a ship, meaning he deliberately sank it while on board. Beverley Gate These days there is almost a romantic air to Beverley Gate and how history was made with the refusal of admittance by Governor John Hotham in April, 1642, which helped trigger the English Civil War. However, prior to that, it served as a place of execution. Both Sir Robert Constable and John Hallam were involved in disturbances in the North which resulted in them both being hanged from Beverley Gate in 1537.\u00a0 Both were hanged on Market Days, meaning the public could watch the execution. The hanging of Constable was recorded in a document at the time. It stated he was to hang in chains until his flesh fell from his bones. That would be a rather gruesome sight shopping in Whitefriargate these days. The gallows The Prospect Centre looked quite different back in the 18th century. At that point it was the White Horse Ings which was a large field, known locally as Whitings Field. It was the scene of public executions for many years until it was purchased on October 28, 1782, by Robert Lakeland and Dr Spencer. The duo paid \u00c2\u00a3550 for the land, with the idea of building a large hospital in open countryside for patients in Hull. Today the site has been built upon so much that the countryside is a distant memory. Public executions were common place in Hull up to August 19, 1778, when John Rogerson was the last person to be publicly hanged in Hull.\u00a0 He was hanged for coining. These gallows were situated on what was known as Pinfold Lane, in the manor of Myton, and today the site is known as Waverley Street, off Hessle Road . Reports from the period state these gallows looked like a tree and it was written that crows would sit on the bows, waiting to feast on the flesh of the deceased. Witch trials You cannot talk of archaic punishments without mentioning the dreaded witch trials. In 1583, three women in Hull were accused of witchcraft. Sentencing involved being tied to the pillory on four market days then sent to prison for a year. The pillory was situated in present day Market Place roughly where the \u00e2\u0080\u009cKing Billy\u00e2\u0080\u009d statue stands today. In 1604, Mary Holland, Jennet Wressell aka Jennet Beaumont, Jennett Butler, Roger Beadneys, and John Willerby were hanged for witchcraft. John Willerby wrote a confession and all of them were removed to the public gallows at Myton for their executions. None of them were burnt as popular culture would have us believe. Fruit assault A lack of respect for the law is not a new thing. During November 1910 PC Pallister was walking along Paragon Street when he noticed a commotion in Little Queen Street. On turning into the street he discovered a number of members of the infamous \u00e2\u0080\u009cSilver Hatchet Gang\u00e2\u0080\u009d fighting.\u00a0 He approached them but they proceeded to attack the police constable with fresh fruit from the nearby stalls. PC Pallister was then assaulted, and eventually John Payton, Charles Moore and Joseph McGowan were arrested and sent for trial. For their part they were each fined \u00c2\u00a310. Watch: information on hangings in Hull Prison Missing church The prisons would be bursting if missing church was still an offence today. But between 1574 and 1601, a number of Catholics were prosecuted in Hull for not going to church. These included Dr Thomas Vavasour, who died in the North Blockhouse on October 26, 1587, and John Acrige, a priest, who was sent to the North Blockhouse and later the Hull Citadel, where he died on March 2, 1585. Many of these were ill-treated with most of them cuffed in chains and left to face their fate. In some cases, the dungeons would fill with water at high tide and drown the prisoners, who were then removed to the churchyard at Drypool and buried. Sending a ghost to prison During April 1849 it was reported that 11-year-old John Henry Whillis was sent to prison for three days after he broke into a property in Hull and hid in the basement with a view to stealing bottles of ale. He was found when a servant walked in and fainted after she thought she had seen a ghost! The boy was arrested and found to be carrying a sack containing three bottles. Rough justice One of the strangest stories from Hull's criminal history involved the arrest and imprisonment of a dog named Rough. The animal belonged to Hull boxer John Rennard who was arrested after the murder of Mary Jane Langley in Preston. Rennard and Rough were together that day, and later when arrested they were both removed to Hull's Central Police Station in Parliament Street and then sent to Hull Prison. Rennard was released and found not guilty but it is unknown what happened to Rough.

"Trusted 16:05 / 27.05.2019 CNN Fiat Chrysler proposes Renault merger in auto industry shake-up If completed, the merger would create the world's third largest carmaker behind Volkswagen ( ) and Toyota ( ) . General Motors ( ) would fall to fourth in the global rankings. Renault ( ) stock surged more than 15% in Paris on Monday, while Fiat Chrysler shares jumped around 11% in Milan. The companies had been discussing ways to cooperate on products and new technologies, but Fiat Chrysler said in a statement outlining its proposal that more could be gained from a merger. \These discussions made clear that broader collaboration through a combination would substantially improve capital efficiency and the speed of product development,\"" the Italian-American company said. Fiat Chrysler owns brands including Jeep, Dodge, Alfa Romeo and Maserati. Among its top markets is North America, where Renault does not have a significant presence. The proposal is the latest example of established automakers seeking partnerships to share the costs of developing new technologies including electric vehicles and autonomous driving systems. German carmakers BMW ( ) and Daimler ( ) have formed a joint venture that will develop ride-sharing and charging services. Ford ( ) and Volkswagen are working together to develop some new vehicles. The trend toward cooperation has accelerated in recent months as carmakers are under increased pressure from electric-car upstarts like Tesla ( ) and tech companies including Uber ( ) . Fiat Chrysler said a merger with Renault would produce annual cost savings of more than \u00e2\u0082\u00ac5 billion ($5.6 billion). The company said no plants would be closed as a result of a merger. Fiat Chrysler was formed as a merger of two struggling automakers. Fiat bought a controlling stake in a Chrysler out of bankruptcy following the US government bailout of the company in 2009. They were formally merged in 2014. But Fiat Chrysler is a distant fourth in US sales and 8th globally. The company has also trailed its competitors in adopting electric vehicle and self-driving technology, which many deem the industry's inevitable future. Sergio Marchionne, its former CEO who passed away a year ago, had spoken openly of the need to merge Fiat Chrysler with a larger automaker to give it the scale and resources to compete. He had even sought a merger with General Motors, only to be rebuffed. He had been far more blunt than other auto executives about the threat to the industry that new entrants such as Google ( ) posed to old-line automakers. Renault is already a member of the world's biggest automotive alliance with Japanese carmakers Nissan ( ) and Mitsubishi Motors. It's not clear how a merger with Fiat Chrysler would affect that alliance, which was thrown into turmoil following the arrest last year of its former leader Carlos Ghosn . Renault holds a 43.5% stake in Nissan, while Nissan owns 15% of Renault. The French carmaker, which sells fewer cars than its Japanese partner, had been pushing for the companies to merge but was rebuffed. While the relationship between Nissan and Renault has been strained following Ghosn's arrest, adding Fiat Chrysler would increase the alliance's annual vehicle sales to 15 million. Renault and Fiat Chrysler both said Monday that a merger would benefit the alliance. Nissan declined to comment. Representatives of Mitsubishi Motors were not immediately available. Regulators are likely to scrutinize any deal between Fiat Chrysler and Renault. Yet the French government, which owns 15% of Renault, indicated Monday that it would support a merger. \""We have large companies which have been built outside of Europe, and today we need big companies to be built within Europe,\"" Sibeth Ndiaye, a spokesperson for the French government, told BFMTV.

"Trusted 16:26 / 27.05.2019 SUN Storm Hannah uncovers mysterious sunken forest buried under peat and sand for 4,500 years ANCIENT MYSTERY A MYSTERIOUS prehistoric forest has risen again on a Welsh beach thanks to Storm Hannah. The collection of ancient tree stumps had been buried under water and sand more than 4,500 years ago and now people are connecting it to an ancient legend about a 'sunken civilisation'. The forest is being associated with a 17th Century myth called 'Cantre'r Gwaelod', or the 'Sunken Hundred'. It is thought that the trees belonged to the ancient forest of Borth, which once stretched for two to three miles along the shore between Ynys-las and Borth in Wales. This area is believed to have been a town surrounded by fertile land for farming and protected by floodgates. An ancient legend dictates that the land was drowned when a priestess called Mererid neglected her duties at the fairy well she was in charge of and allowed it to overflow. This petrified forest has been partially uncovered before but never to this extent. The area is often referred to as the Atlantis of Wales and various archaeological discoveries have been made here including fossilised human and animal footprints. Some locals say that they can still hear the bells of the drowned church of Cantre'r Gwaelod on a quiet day. High speed winds from Storm Hannah managed to unearth the prehistoric tree roots that had been preserved under a deep layer of peat and sand. This is the first time some of these trees would have been seen for thousands of years.

"Women are happier if they don't get married or have kids, says a happiness expert But apparently that is not the case for women. According to a \u00e2\u0080\u0098happiness expert', women should \u00e2\u0080\u0098not bother' getting married as it may have a negative impact on their wellbeing. Men, on the other hand, \u00e2\u0080\u0098calm down' and take less risks when they are married, reports . Paul Dolan, professor of behavioural science at the London School of Economics, spoke about women's happiness at the Hay Festival over the weekend. He said: \The healthiest and happiest population sub-group are women who never married or had children. \""We do have some good longitudinal data following the same people over time, but I am going to do a massive disservice to that science and just say: if you're a man, you should probably get married; if you're a woman, don't bother.\"" This idea is further explored in Dolan's latest book, Happy Ever After: Escaping The Myth of The Perfect Life, in which he looks at results from the American Time Use Survey comparing levels of pleasure and misery in unmarried, married, divorced, separated and widowed people. Levels of happiness for married women were only found to be higher when their spouse was in the room with them. \""Married people are happier than other population sub-groups but only when their spouse is in the room when they're asked how happy they are,\"" he explained. \""When the spouse is not present: f***ing miserable.\"" Even with all the benefits of staying single and childless, Dolan acknowledges that having a partner and a baby are viewed by some as signs of success, and this could lead some women to feel unhappy and as if they are failing if they don't manage to find them. He added: \""You see a single woman of 40, who has never had children [and you think], 'That's a shame isn't it, maybe one day you'll meet the right guy and that'll change'. \""No, maybe she'll meet the wrong guy... maybe she'll meet a guy who makes her less happy and healthy, and die sooner.\"" It's certainly something to think about.

"Trusted 11:59 / 27.05.2019 SUN Samsung Galaxy Note 10 with FOUR rear cameras pictured in new renders They suggest the Samsung Galaxy Note 10, due for release in August, will come with four cameras on the back lined up in a vertical strip in the top left corner. The Note 10 will be the followup to Samsung's highly acclaimed Galaxy S10, which arguably boasts the best smartphone display of all time. If previous releases are anything to go by, the Note 10 will be a larger gadget with similar specs to the S10, and will likely cost around \u00c2\u00a31,000. New renders of the Note 10 were put together by Phone Arena based on all current rumours surrounding the gizmo. On the front, the phone has Samsung's curved Infinity-O display with a small hole for the camera at the top. On the back, the camera system has four lenses in a vertical line along the top left hand side. These will most likely consist of a wide-angle, tele-photo and macro cameras alongside the main snapper. The Note 10 will come with at least five colour options, according to the renders. It'll come in Prism Black, Prism White, and Flaming Pink at launch, with green and yellow options coming later down the line, rumours suggest. Rumours suggest the Note 10 will come in four variants, each with a slightly different set of specs and features. At least one of these will\u00a0support super-fast 5G internet speeds. Samsung has already unveiled two 5G phones already: the Galaxy S10 5G Edition and the foldable Galaxy Fold . But the first of the pair won't arrive in the UK until May, which is just a few months before the rumoured Galaxy Note 10 release date. In any case, Samsung hasn't actually confirmed any new features for the Galaxy Note 10 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or even acknowledged its existence. But the company has reliably produced a Note handset in late summer/early autumn for years, and there's no reason why 2019 should be any different. CORE OF THE PROBLEM?

"WPP AUNZ appoints Jens Monsees as chief executive officer and managing director WPP AUNZ appoints Jens Monsees as chief executive officer and managing director WPP AUNZ has announced today the appointment of Jens Monsees as chief executive officer and managing director effective October 1, 2019. The appointment fills the void following the departure of Mike Connaghan in October last year Monsees will join WPP AUNZ from the BMW Group, where he was most recently corporate vice president leading global digital strategy, corporate planning and product strategy. During his time at BMW, Monsees has been instrumental in the business and cultural transformation of the global BMW Group from a traditional Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) into a customer- focused and data-driven mobility tech company. Prior to BMW, Monsees held a range of senior executive positions in digital marketing and branding, including: global CEO, digital marketing at Arvato AG (part of the Bertelsmann Group); branding director for automotive, consumer goods, food retail and health care at Google Germany; and various other marketing and branding roles at Mondelez and Schwarzkopf &amp; Henkel. Says Rob Mactier, chairman, WPP AUNZ: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe board conducted an extensive global search to identify the best leader for the company. This appointment underlines our new positioning as a leader not only in creative advertising, branding, communications and media but in technology, data and business transformation. Jens has a strong reputation for building brands and leading change in several industries. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe brings rich experience and client-side insights to the role, at a time when the changing needs of our clients are paramount. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Board also had a strong focus on the right cultural fit. Jens has built strong, diverse teams with a focus on collaborative culture creation. I have no doubt that he will inspire and lead the tremendous talent around him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Says Monsees: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m impressed by the creativity, dedication and drive for performance of the WPP AUNZ team and their clear ambition to be the \u00e2\u0080\u009cgo to\u00e2\u0080\u009d partner for clients as we all take on the challenges of a rapidly changing digital world. In this dynamic environment, the potential for WPP AUNZ, as well as for our partners and clients is tremendous. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m absolutely convinced that together, we will be able to build stronger business models and stimulate growth by harnessing our deep creative and digital expertise. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am looking forward to working with John Steedman and the executive leadership team to keep developing and empowering our talent. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m excited to build on Mark Read\u00e2\u0080\u0099s global strategy for a new era of creative transformation and to support the translation of that strategy into outcomes that build long-term profitable growth for the company, and for our shareholders.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cImportantly, I am also looking forward to moving to Sydney with my family. We have spent time in Australia over the years and what strikes me is the openness of the people, the frankness in the conversation and the ambition in business.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Monsees will take over from John Steedman, who stepped in as interim CEO in October 2018. Steedman will continue to lead WPP AUNZ with the executive leadership team until Mr Monsees takes up his position. Steedman, with his extensive knowledge and long history with WPP AUNZ, will also work closely with Monsees to ensure a smooth handover. He and the executive team will be key partners of the new CEO. Upon Monsees\u00e2\u0080\u0099 commencement, Steedman will continue in his role as executive director and chairman, media investment management, WPP AUNZ. Says Mark Read, CEO, WPP: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we relaunched WPP plc as a creative transformation company last December we promised to put great ideas, technology and data at the heart of our new client offer. Australia and New Zealand are among the most exciting, vibrant and forward-looking markets in the world. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe AUNZ team has WPP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full support as it embarks on the next stage of its journey under Jens\u00e2\u0080\u0099 leadership.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"

"Duke of Cumberland in Cottingham reopens after \u00c2\u00a3150,000 makeover - and punters love it Pub retailer Marston's has spent almost \u00c2\u00a3150,000 to refurbish the Duke of Cumberland in Market Green . After \growing tired\"" over the past few years the pub was in need of a bit of work to kick-start business for returning owners John and Lisa Mowforth. After three weeks of knocking down walls, creating more space for dining and giving the place a fresh lick of paint, the owners say they are \""over the moon\"" with the makeover. John, 59, said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is outstanding. We are all over the moon. Everybody has commented on how beautiful the place looks. \""It has been a fantastic start. We couldn't have asked for better. Everybody loves it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See more pictures in the gallery below The pub re-opened on Friday evening, May 24, with dozens of locals flocking in to take a look at the place for themselves. The couple are looking to push an extensive menu to keep the customer coming in, which started with the traditional Sunday lunch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt has been very busy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said John. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe people of the village mentioned that this is the place to be and that there had been a long time waiting for something like this. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere has been fantastic feedback across the weekend and hopefully we can push it more. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy 3pm on Sunday we had to close the kitchen because the bar was so packed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are pushing food so we will be opening later until 9pm and we are looking to have steak nights, fish and tapas back on the menu along with nice quality beer, wine and a gin menu. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHopefully we will push it as best we can and make it a success for the next five years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Follow Hull Live Our daily newsletter - To get the latest headlines direct to your email inbox every day, click here .

Chilling Google search before wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s murder
"The cheap and cheerful curry place in the heart of Hull city centre Regeneration works and the Hull Marina development means more people than ever are choosing the city centre's cobbled streets as a social destination, having pints in the historic pubs, cocktails in the chic bars and fabulous food in most of the establishments. If someone mentioned to me about going for food in Old Town , I would immediately suggest The Lion &amp; Key for fish and chips, or a pie at The Crown &amp; Cushion. But I have found a gem that works equally as well for a relaxed meal with friends, or as a precursor to a night on the town. Chilli Devil's in Manor Street is Hull's smallest pub, and the brainchild of Ian Ibbetson, who started his food venture at Chilli Towers in Arthur Street creating chilli sauces, which can still be bought from the restaurant and bar. When a friend and I arrived on a Thursday evening, we were the only people in this tiny pub, but that wasn't to be for long as more people arrived, including couples and those on their own out for a bite to eat. Read More Food and drink news in Hull We ordered a pint of Staropramen lager and Blue Moon craft beer, which are permanently on tap, with the other four draught options, usually real ales from Yorkshire breweries, on a cycle of rotation. There isn't a menu as such, just the knowledge that there will be three dishes made with chilli available each night, which can include such exotic ingredients as llama stew, goat curry, kangaroo, alpaca and more. The three dishes available when we visited were garlic piri piri chicken, Moroccan lamb curry and a vegan Mexican bean chilli. It also provides burgers and hot dogs, as well as light bites for those wanting a snack alongside their pint. We ordered the chicken and the lamb curries and at just \u00c2\u00a36 each, they were a real steal. It wasn't long before two bowls of steaming hot curry were brought to us, and we were told if they were too spicy we could have as much soured cream as we wanted, or if we wanted it spicing up we just needed to ask at the bar. The bowls look quite small, but when you start eating the moreish food, you soon realise there is more than meets the eye, and we were suitably well-fed by the end. The lamb curry contained what appeared to be okra, chunks of lamb, peppers, tomatoes, raisins, apricots and, of course, chilli. It wasn't overwhelmingly spicy, but you wouldn't expect there to be lots of heat from an authentic North African dish. However, there was a subtle warmth. Personally, I could have done without the soured cream, but it did mix well with the curry to create a more creamy texture. The garlic chicken was a drier dish, containing large chunks of succulent chicken that had been marinated in a chilli and garlic mix. This too wasn't overly hot with, but it went down well with my fellow diner, who finished every last morsel. After our meals, we saw there was a tequila menu, with guests able to choose shots of tequila or enjoy a hand-crafted cocktail. We happily sipped on our tequila cocktails \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a double tequila margarita and a sierra coffee tequila with orange \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and decided we quite fancied a pudding. We ordered a hot chocolate fudge cake to share (\u00c2\u00a34) and it was beautifully moist. We had ice cream on the side and the cake arrived with lashings of homemade raspberry sauce. It may be because we were in a chill-centric environment, but we could have sworn there was a kick to it. Chilli Devil's is the perfect place for an informal dinner date or bite to eat in the heart of Hull's Old Town, and it is fantastic to see such care with the quality of ingredients and flavours. We will certainly be returning, especially to try the new Sunday lunch menu, but we will remember to bring cash as they don't accept debit cards.

WATCH: The criminals locked up in Hull in March 2019 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw an object being guarded by police in one of the cross streets, which might have been a weapon of some kind. Officers hid it from view by putting a bag in front of it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs I arrived an ambulance was just leaving the scene with its sirens on, but another ambulances was parked in one of the cross streets and was surrounded by police.

The driver then opens the door to her vehicle, exits the car, and hops through the window while outside winds appear to blow paper bags, cups and other items into the restaurant. Her passenger follows closely behind her, hopping through the window as an employee beckons both inside. The remaining footage, which appears to have been taken by a security camera, shows the customers, along with the Chick-fil-A staff, taking shelter further inside the restaurant. No one was injured during the incident, Fox 8 reports. Local officials confirmed to KFOR that a possible tornado was in the area at the time.

"Google is reportedly tracking your purchases through Gmail Any purchase you make that uses your Gmail account will be logged by Google, according to a discovery recently made recently by a Reddit user. The user uncovered that Google is keeping tabs on any purchase that uses your Gmail account. Google also tracks purchases made via Google Pay or via the Google Play store. For its part, Google says the purchase information lives in your Google Account and is only accessible by you. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo help you easily view and keep track of your purchases, bookings and subscriptions in one place, we've created a private destination that can only be seen by you. You can delete this information at any time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a Google spokesperson told Fox News in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don't use any information from your Gmail messages to serve you ads and that includes the email receipts and confirmations shown on the Purchase page,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the spokesperson added. But it's not clear what else Google may be using the information for, as pointed out by BleepingComputer, a publication that covers information security and technology. And it's not clear how to prevent Google from extracting this data from Gmail. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no problems with features like this. Just give us the control to disable them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lawrence Abrams, the creator and owner of BleepingComputer, told Fox News. Abrams added that he viewed it as an invasion of privacy. Like Facebook, Google's business model is based on knowing a lot about you. Data collection is done for advertising and to improve Google services. And while not intentionally nefarious, a lot of this is done in the background unbeknownst to the average user. Ostensibly, there should be a way to control purchase tracking via a setting such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cPrivacy &amp; Personalization\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cData and Personalization\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 both accessible on your Google account home page \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but that doesn't appear to be the case. This issue was addressed in other reports too, which found no way to completely turn off tracking. It's easy to check what Google has tracked so far by going to your Google \u00e2\u0080\u009cPurchases\u00e2\u0080\u009d page. A check of my page revealed everything I had purchased going back to 2013, including reloads on a Starbucks card, iTunes purchases and flight reservations. If you don't want to store this data, you can remove purchases one at a time. When you do this, you're sent to your Gmail and you delete the purchase there. There is no single setting that will do this en masse for all your purchases. Google is looking into simplifying the settings further to make it easier for people to control, the company added.

"Love Island 2019 rumoured line-up revealed And this year's romantic reality show Love Island is almost upon us with the first episode set to air on Monday, June 3. But who's going into the famous villa this year? As always, the Love Island cast is kept closely under wraps by ITV bosses, virtually until all the contestants have arrived at their island paradise. But here we take a look at who is rumoured to be going in... Amber Rose Gill The very first contestant 'confirmed' for Love Island 2019 has been unveiled as Amber Rose Gill. The pretty beauty therapist from Newcastle flew out to Majorca this weekend after signing up for the ITV2 show, The Sun reports. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmber is a down to earth and fun-loving girl. She loves to party and is always out in Newcastle,\ a source said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe's beautiful and looks incredible in a bikini and unlike other previous stars of the show doesn't have masses of Instagram followers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Molly-Mae Hague Blonde beach-lover Molly has reportedly been selected thanks to her huge social media presence. The vlogger's Instagram account is awash with pictures from far-flung places, and she has her own YouTube channel where she offers fashion advice and plugs brands such as Pretty Little Thing. Jada Sezer Love Island insiders say plus-sized model Jada Sezer is among those being lined up to enter the villa. ITV2 bosses reportedly want a more diverse range of body shapes on the show after receiving criticism in the past. Jada, 30, hosts podcasts encouraging women to love their bodies and has run the London Marathon in just underwear and trainers. She said this year: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm a size 16 and I've always been a size 16. A source said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cPrevious years have been criticised for a lack of diversity among contestants. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis year producers are determined to have more variation among the Islanders. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey want all shapes and sizes taking part \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not just a stream of identikit young men and women. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGiven the nature of the show, it's important the contestants feel body confident as they spend so much time wearing skimpy clothes or bikinis as they sunbathe and hang out by the pool. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJada would be a perfect choice because she is passionate about body positivity \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and even appeared on Good Morning Britain in her underwear before running the marathon. \u00e2\u0080\u009cProducers have been talking at length with her and are hopeful they might feature her later in the series.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Curtis Pritchard Strictly Come Dancing star AJ Pritchard's younger brother Curtis has reportedly signed up for Love Island. The pro dancer, 23, is believed to fly out to the villa in Majorca next month. This comes after Curtis hit the headlines with brother AJ back in December after a group of thugs attacked them in a Cheshire nightclub. Tommy Fury Tyson Fury 's little brother Tommy could be breaking hearts this summer in the Love Island villa. It's been rumoured that the 19-year-old, who is also a boxer, with two wins from two fights, has joined the line-up for the ITV2 dating show which is set to start in a matter of weeks. And his famous boxer brother seems to have confirmed his appearance. Appearing on an MMA show on ESPN, Fury claimed his younger sibling will be featuring on the programme this summer. Fury said: \""He's going on a TV show called Love Island. \""He's a good looking young kid and I think he's going to be a hit with the ladies on it.\"" With his rippling muscles and smoldering good looks Tommy fortunately looks nothing like his bald-headed heavyweight championship boxer brother. According to insiders Tommy is extremely appealing to Love Island bosses as he's already got a huge following and convinced he will stir up drama among the other lads because of his sporting background. A source told the Daily Star: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTommy is one of the hottest young boxers on the circuit. He's already got a huge following, and has been getting quite a lot of attention from the girls. \""He's been out and about in Manchester over the last few months since splitting up with his ex and always cleans up. \""He's very confident when it comes to the ladies. He's got a lot of cheeky banter and isn't shy in coming forward.\"" Kobi-Jean Cole Reigning GB beauty queen Kobi-Jean Cole, 23, has dropped huge hints she's going into the villa. Kobi-Jean has been getting in shape with celebrity fitness guru Matt Fiddes, who also works with Love Island's Megan Barton-Hanson. In a post from his last work-out with Kobi, Matt captioned it: \""What's is she getting in shape for? \""Training hard with @missgb_official @missgreatbritain18_19 she is in amazing shape and working so hard! \""Single and full dedicated to her goals!\"" Kobi then added: \""Ahhh so exciting!! Not long now.\"" He went on to say he'd be glad when she's out of the country so he can have a break, adding emojis of palm trees, a winking face and a thumbs-up. Sav Berry Social media influencer Sav Berry, 23, will be one of the first batch of Love Islanders according to Daily Star Online. The website says it has been shown pictures of him standing in front of a pink background with brightly coloured beachwear on \u00e2\u0080\u0093 typical of the promotional images associated with the show. They've also allegedly seen a snap of the Sav strutting in front of a black and white background, as seen in the past during the show's intro videos. Soph Piper After the popularity of 2018's winner Dani Dyer - daughter of actor Danny Dyer - LI bosses wouldn't be blamed for wanting to choose another relative of a celebrity. According to The Sun, producers are \""desperate\"" to sign the younger sister of Saturdays singer turned TV presenter Rochelle Humes. Model Soph Piper, 20, looks exactly like her famous sister, who she was recently reunited with after a family rift caused a feud for years. Love Island series three winner Kem Cetinay was responsible for the reunion as he'd known Soph since he was 10 and was at a party with Rochelle enjoying his post LI-fame. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wouldn't be surprised if [producers] tried to [sign her up] because of course, it'd be an amazing story.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lotan Carter A familiar face who's been put forward for Love Island is Big Brother star Lotan Carter. Lotan was said to be in talks with bosses to appear, two years after he was kicked out of the BB house for aggressive behaviour. Now it seems he wants to stage his comeback with ITV2's biggest dating show, with a source telling the Sun: \""Producers seemed really interested but he's worried his reality show past might work against him. \""Lotan wants to find The One and hopes that he can find someone to settle down with through the show.\"" Lotan's last TV appearance saw him appear in the Britain's Got Talent final in 2018, as part of Channing Tatum's Magic Mike Live group. It wouldn't be the first time Island bosses have selected someone previously known to their target audience - Dani Dyer , who won Love Island 2018 with her then-boyfriend Jack Fincham had previously appeared in Survival Of The Fittest and was already famous for being Danny Dyer's daughter. Anthony Joshua Anthony Joshua was put forward as the first name of Love Island 2019 - by none other than one of last year's cast. The 29-year-old champion boxer would be a huge name for the ITV2 show if producers can lure him to Majorca to woo his way through the ladies. And it was Love Island 2018's Josh Denzel who hinted that the 6ft 2in athlete could be taking part, after sharing a snap of the two of them at the boxing at the 02 over Christmas. Taking to Instagram, Josh wrote: \""Merry Christmas ya filthy animals - @anthony_joshua . \""What a way to end the year. ringside at the boxing with the big man. (Love Island 2019 watch this space).\"" Predictably, his fans went wild and demanded to know if Josh was telling the truth. \""Is he actually going on there,\"" one asked. Another quipped: \""Jesus f**king Christ my vagina can't cope with this.\"" And a third wrote: \""Adapting my Christmas list last minute request.\"" Josh and Anthony go back a long way, with the boxer even tipping his mate to win last year's Love Island with his ex Kazimir Crossley. Speaking to Mirror Online ahead of the final , Anthony admitted: \""I don't watch it... because I don't have time to. But I've been supporting Josh. \""He's doing well. He's a lovely lad anyway. Big up Josh.\"" He then hinted he would put a bet on Josh to walk away with the \u00c2\u00a350,000 cash prize, adding: \""Do they have odds on him to win? I might put a cheeky pink note behind him to win! Get voting!\"" Love Island starts on ITV on Monday, June 3 at 9pm.

"Trusted 11:59 / 27.05.2019 Lancashire Post \I ended up getting a fine for driving down that road, because my sat-nav told me to go that way.\"" - Your reaction to the latest Fishergate bus lane camera figures The latest Fishergate bus lane camera figures have been revealed Over 30,000 tickets have been issued in the past 12 months, with almost 600 vehicles a week being clocked by the cameras despite an on-going publicity campaign to drive the message home. These latest figures have left County Hall chiefs baffled. Coun Keith Iddon, cabinet member for highways and transport, said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just don't understand it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm really disappointed because we've done everything we possibly can to warn people, yet they're still driving down there in large numbers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This was your reaction on social media: My Google maps app always tries to take me that way to the train station (I use it for live traffic to find quickest route) I know better and don't turn down Queen Street off London Road, but people unfamiliar with Preston would just follow their sat nav instructions. I think the council should update the street maps with the restrictions. Joanne Baybutt The whole of inner town baffles me driving .. I Used to know the route by the back of Avenham coming out onto the main St ... but all changed now I just don't do it. Helen Molloy People who don't know Preston find that end of town confusing , I think the council need a rethink on the layout as you can get backed into a corner with the one ways and dead ends. Gary Martin I have said before, if it isn't about raising money, they should put a rising bollard in, so buses can get through &amp; cars can't. Martin Reynolds \u200b People don't understand what alternatives there are, especially if they are not local. At least the council is generating some finances. Maybe use it on much deserved services...? Abida Rasool I don't know Preston well and followed the sign but kept going round in circles! A taxi in front of me went along the lane and I followed him as I was so frustrated. A few days later I got my fine. Not been to Preston since! Suziesue Chev The signs are easy to see and l still cannot understand how people are still getting caught out! Russ Waring \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just don't understand it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Coun Keith Iddon, cabinet member for highways and transport. That statement sums up everything. You would think that they would understand if they make the policies but no and hence the situation. The blocking of Fishergate is an excellent idea but to deliver it you need a viable alternative route not a 20 minute detour using the overcrowded Ringway. Make a connection from Garden St to Butler st. Oh and do something about all those flouting the one way section to rejoin Corporation St from Charnley st. Allow cars to exit fox st to Fleet St. Martin Catterall How about the old tried and tested method of a couple of no entry signs and some much-needed road markings down there.. John Lancaster I ended up getting a fine for driving down that road, because my sat-nav told me to go that way. Apparently they wouldn't send the fine to google though, so I had to pay it ?
